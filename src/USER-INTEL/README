-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This package is based on the USER-OMP package and provides LAMMPS styles that:

   1. include support for single and mixed precision in addition to double.
   2. include modifications to support vectorization for key routines
   3. include modifications to support offload to Intel(R) Xeon Phi(TM) 
      coprocessors

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

When using the suffix command with "intel", intel styles will be used if they
exist. If the suffix command is used with "hybrid intel omp" and the USER-OMP 
USER-OMP styles will be used whenever USER-INTEL styles are not available. This
allow for running most styles in LAMMPS with threading. For example, in the
latter case with the USER-OMP package installed,

      kspace_style     pppm 1e-4

is equivalent to:

      kspace_style     pppm/omp   1e-4

because no pppm style has been implemented for the Intel package.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to use offload to Intel(R) Xeon Phi(TM) coprocessors, the flag 
-DLMP_INTEL_OFFLOAD should be set in the Makefile. Offload requires the use of 
Intel compilers.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For portability reasons, vectorization directives are currently only enabled 
for Intel compilers. Using other compilers may result in significantly
lower performance. This behavior can be changed by defining 
LMP_SIMD_COMPILER for the preprocessor (see intel_preprocess.h).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

By default, when running with offload to Intel(R) coprocessors, affinity
for host MPI tasks and OpenMP threads is set automatically within the code.
This currently requires the use of system calls. To disable at build time,
compile with -DINTEL_OFFLOAD_NOAFFINITY.
