<H3>compute temp command 
</H3>
<H3>compute temp/cuda command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>compute ID group-ID temp 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID, group-ID are documented in <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> command
<LI>temp = style name of this compute command 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>compute 1 all temp
compute myTemp mobile temp 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a computation that calculates the temperature of a group of
atoms.  A compute of this style can be used by any command that
computes a temperature, e.g. <A HREF = "thermo_modify.html">thermo_modify</A>, <A HREF = "fix_temp_rescale.html">fix
temp/rescale</A>, <A HREF = "fix_nh.html">fix npt</A>, etc.
</P>
<P>The temperature is calculated by the formula KE = dim/2 N k T, where
KE = total kinetic energy of the group of atoms (sum of 1/2 m v^2),
dim = 2 or 3 = dimensionality of the simulation, N = number of atoms
in the group, k = Boltzmann constant, and T = temperature.
</P>
<P>A kinetic energy tensor, stored as a 6-element vector, is also
calculated by this compute for use in the computation of a pressure
tensor.  The formula for the components of the tensor is the same as
the above formula, except that v^2 is replaced by vx*vy for the xy
component, etc.  The 6 components of the vector are ordered xx, yy,
zz, xy, xz, yz.
</P>
<P>The number of atoms contributing to the temperature is assumed to be
constant for the duration of the run; use the <I>dynamic</I> option of the
<A HREF = "compute_modify.html">compute_modify</A> command if this is not the case.
</P>
<P>This compute subtracts out degrees-of-freedom due to fixes that
constrain molecular motion, such as <A HREF = "fix_shake.html">fix shake</A> and
<A HREF = "fix_rigid.html">fix rigid</A>.  This means the temperature of groups of
atoms that include these constraints will be computed correctly.  If
needed, the subtracted degrees-of-freedom can be altered using the
<I>extra</I> option of the <A HREF = "compute_modify.html">compute_modify</A> command.
</P>
<P>A compute of this style with the ID of "thermo_temp" is created when
LAMMPS starts up, as if this command were in the input script:
</P>
<PRE>compute thermo_temp all temp 
</PRE>
<P>See the "thermo_style" command for more details.
</P>
<P>See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_16">this howto section</A> of the manual for
a discussion of different ways to compute temperature and perform
thermostatting.
</P>
<HR>

<P>Styles with a <I>cuda</I> suffix are functionally the same as the
corresponding style without the suffix.  They have been optimized to
run faster, depending on your available hardware, as discussed in
<A HREF = "Section_accelerate.html">Section_accelerate</A> of the manual.  The
accelerated styles take the same arguments and should produce the same
results, except for round-off and precision issues.
</P>
<P>These accelerated styles are part of the USER-CUDA package.  They are
only enabled if LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info.
</P>
<P>You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_7">-suffix command-line
switch</A> when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can
use the <A HREF = "suffix.html">suffix</A> command in your input script.
</P>
<P>See <A HREF = "Section_accelerate.html">Section_accelerate</A> of the manual for
more instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Output info:</B>
</P>
<P>This compute calculates a global scalar (the temperature) and a global
vector of length 6 (KE tensor), which can be accessed by indices 1-6.
These values can be used by any command that uses global scalar or
vector values from a compute as input.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_15">this
section</A> for an overview of LAMMPS output
options.
</P>
<P>The scalar value calculated by this compute is "intensive".  The
vector are "extensive".
</P>
<P>The scalar value will be in temperature <A HREF = "units.html">units</A>.  The
vector values will be in energy <A HREF = "units.html">units</A>.
