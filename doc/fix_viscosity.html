<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Use the Muller-Plathe algorithm described in <A HREF = "#Muller-Plathe">this
paper</A> to exchange momenta between two particles in
different regions of the simulation box every N steps.  This induces a
shear velocity profile in the system.  As described below this enables
a viscosity of the fluid to be calculated.  This algorithm is
sometimes called a reverse non-equilibrium MD (reverse NEMD) approach
to computing viscosity.  This is because the usual NEMD approach is to
impose a shear velocity profile on the system and measure the response
via an off-diagonal component of the stress tensor, which is
proportional to the momentum flux.  In the Muller-Plathe method, the
momentum flux is imposed, and the shear velocity profile is the
system's response.
</P>
<P>The simulation box is divided into <I>Nbin</I> layers in the <I>pdim</I>
direction.  Every N steps, Nswap pairs of atoms are chosen in the
following manner.  Only atoms in the fix group are considered.  Nswap
atoms in the bottom layer with positive velocity components in the
<I>vdim</I> direction closest to the target value <I>V</I> are selected.
Similarly, Nswap atoms in the middle later with negative velocity
components in the <I>vdim</I> direction closest to the negative of the
target value <I>V</I> are selected.  The two sets of Nswap atoms are paired
up and their <I>vdim</I> momenta components are swapped within each pair.
This resets their velocities, typically in opposite directions.  Over
time, this induces a shear velocity profile in the system which can be
measured using commands such as the following, which writes the
profile to the file tmp.profile:
</P>
<PRE>fix f1 all ave/spatial 100 10 1000 z lower 0.05 vx &
    file tmp.profile units reduced 
</PRE>
<P>Note that by default, Nswap = 1 and vtarget = INF, though this can be
changed by the optional <I>swap</I> and <I>vtarget</I> keywords.  When vtarget =
INF, one or more atoms with the most positive and negative velocity
components are selected.  Setting these parameters appropriately, in
conjunction with the swap rate N, allows the momentum flux rate to be
adjusted across a wide range of values, and the momenta to be
exchanged in large chunks or more smoothly.
</P>
<P>As described below, the total momentum transferred by these velocity
swaps is computed by the fix and can be output.  Dividing this
quantity by time and the cross-sectional area of the simulation box
yields a momentum flux.  The ratio of momentum flux to the slope of
the shear velocity profile is the viscosity of the fluid, in
appopriate units.  See the <A HREF = "#Muller-Plathe">Muller-Plathe paper</A> for
details.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: After equilibration, if the velocity profile you
observe is not linear, then you are likely swapping momentum too
frequently and are not in a regime of linear response.  In this case
you cannot accurately infer a viscosity and should try increasing
the Nevery parameter.
</P>
<P>An alternative method for calculating a viscosity is to run a NEMD
simulation, as described in <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#4_13">this section</A> of
the manual.  NEMD simulations deform the simmulation box via the <A HREF = "fix_deform.html">fix
deform</A> command.  Thus they cannot be run on a charged
system using a <A HREF = "kspace_style.html">PPPM solver</A> since PPPM does not
currently support non-orthogonal boxes.  Using fix viscosity keeps the
box orthogonal; thus it does not suffer from this limitation.
</P>
<P><B>Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:</B>
</P>
<P>No information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.  None of the <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> options
are relevant to this fix.
</P>
<P>The cummulative momentum transferred between the bottom and middle of
the simulation box (in the <I>pdim</I> direction) is stored as a scalar
quantity by this fix.  This quantity is zeroed when the fix is defined
and accumlates thereafter, once every N steps.  The units of the
quantity are momentum = mass*velocity.  This quantity can be accessed
by various <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#4_15">output commands</A>, such as
<A HREF = "thermo_style.html">thermo_style custom</A>.  The scalar value calculated
by this fix is "intensive", meaning it is independent of the number of
atoms in the simulation.
</P>
<P>No parameter of this fix can be used with the <I>start/stop</I> keywords of
the <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command.  This fix is not invoked during <A HREF = "minimize.html">energy
minimization</A>.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>If the masses of all exchange partners are the same, then swaps
conserve both momentum and kinetic energy.  Thus you should not need
to thermostat the system.  If you do use a thermostat, you may want to
apply it only to the non-swapped dimensions (other than <I>vdim</I>).
</P>
<P>LAMMPS does not check, but you should not use this fix to swap
velocities of atoms that are in constrained molecules, e.g. via <A HREF = "fix_shake.html">fix
shake</A> or <A HREF = "fix_rigid.html">fix rigid</A>.  This is because
application of the constraints will alter the amount of transferred
momentum.  You should, however, be able to use flexible molecules.
See the <A HREF = "#Maginn">Maginn paper</A> for an example of using this algorithm
in a computation of alcohol molecule properties.
</P>
<P>When running a simulation with large, massive particles or molecules
in a background solvent, you may want to only exchange momenta bewteen
solvent particles.
