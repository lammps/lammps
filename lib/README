This directory contains libraries that can be linked with when
building LAMMPS, if particular packages are included in a LAMMPS
build.  The library itself must be built first, so that a library file
exists for LAMMPS to link against.

Each library directory contains a README with additional info about
how to acquire and/or build the library.  This may require you to edit
one of the provided Makefiles to make it suitable for your machine.

The libraries included in the LAMMPS distribution are the following:
