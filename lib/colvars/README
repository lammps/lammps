## Collective variables module (Colvars)

A software module for molecular simulation and analysis that provides a
high-performance implementation of sampling algorithms defined on a reduced
space of continuously differentiable functions (aka collective variables).

The module itself implements a variety of functions and algorithms, including
free-energy estimators based on thermodynamic forces, non-equilibrium work and
probability distributions.

## How to build

This directory has source files to build a library that LAMMPS
links against when using the USER-COLVARS package.

This library must be built with a C++ compiler, *before* LAMMPS is built and
*after* packages are configured, so that LAMMPS can link against it.
You can use the provided Makefile.* files or create your own, specific to your
compiler and system.  For example:

  cd src
  make yes-user-colvars
  cd ../lib/colvars
  make -f Makefile.g++

where Makefile.g++ uses the GNU C++ compiler and is a good template to start.

**Optional**: if you use the Install.py script provided in this folder, you
can give the machine name as the '-m' argument.  This can be the suffix of one
of the files from either this folder, or from src/MAKE/MACHINES.
*This is only supported by the Install.py within the lib/colvars folder*.

When you are done building this library, two files should
exist in this directory:

libcolvars.a		the library LAMMPS will link against
Makefile.lammps		settings the LAMMPS Makefile will import

IMPORTANT: You must examine the final Makefile.lammps to insure it is
correct for your system, else the LAMMPS build will likely fail.

If you want to set a debug flag recognized by the library, the
settings in Makefile.common should work.

Note: some Colvars functions use the Lepton mathematical expression parser,
which is here included (no additional steps required).  For more details, see:
  https://simtk.org/projects/lepton
Starting from 2019-06-02, Lepton requires C++11.  Please see:
