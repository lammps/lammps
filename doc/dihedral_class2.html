<P>where Ed is the dihedral term, Embt is a middle-bond-torsion term,
Eebt is an end-bond-torsion term, Eat is an angle-torsion term, Eaat
is an angle-angle-torsion term, and Ebb13 is a bond-bond-13 term.
</P>
<P>Theta1 and theta2 are equilibrium angles and r1 r2 r3 are equilibrium
bond lengths.

<P>See <A HREF = "#Sun">(Sun)</A> for a description of the COMPASS class2 force field.
</P>
<P>Coefficients for the Ed, Embt, Eebt, Eat, Eaat, and Ebb13 formulas
must be defined for each dihedral type via the
<A HREF = "dihedral_coeff.html">dihedral_coeff</A> command as in the example above,
or in the data file or restart files read by the
<A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> or <A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A>
commands.

<P>These are the 6 coefficients for the Ed formula:

<LI>phi1 (degrees)
<LI>K2 (energy)
<LI>phi2 (degrees)
<LI>K3 (energy)
<LI>phi3 (degrees) 
</UL>
<P>For the Embt formula, each line in a
<A HREF = "dihedral_coeff.html">dihedral_coeff</A> command in the input script lists
5 coefficients, the first of which is "mbt" to indicate they are
MiddleBondTorsion coefficients.  In a data file, these coefficients
should be listed under a "MiddleBondTorsion Coeffs" heading and you
must leave out the "mbt", i.e. only list 4 coefficients after the
dihedral type.

<P>Theta1 and theta2 are specified in degrees, but LAMMPS converts them
to radians internally; hence the units of D and E are in
energy/radian.

4 coefficients, the first of which is "aat" to indicate they are
AngleAngleTorsion coefficients.  In a data file, these coefficients

must leave out the "aat", i.e. only list 3 coefficients after the
dihedral type.

<P>Styles with a <I>cuda</I>, <I>gpu</I>, <I>intel</I>, <I>kk</I>, <I>omp</I>, or <I>opt</I> suffix are
functionally the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.
They have been optimized to run faster, depending on your available
hardware, as discussed in <A HREF = "Section_accelerate.html">Section_accelerate</A>
of the manual.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and
should produce the same results, except for round-off and precision
issues.
</P>
<P>These accelerated styles are part of the USER-CUDA, GPU, USER-INTEL,
KOKKOS, USER-OMP and OPT packages, respectively.  They are only
enabled if LAMMPS was built with those packages.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info.
</P>
<P>You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_7">-suffix command-line
switch</A> when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can
use the <A HREF = "suffix.html">suffix</A> command in your input script.
</P>
<P>See <A HREF = "Section_accelerate.html">Section_accelerate</A> of the manual for
more instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This dihedral style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
CLASS2 package.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making LAMMPS</A>
section for more info on packages.
