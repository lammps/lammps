angle_style harmonic command :h3

[Syntax:]

angle_style harmonic :pre

[Examples:]

angle_style harmonic
angle_coeff 1 300.0 107.0 :pre

[Description:]

The {harmonic} angle style uses the potential

:c,image(Eqs/angle_harmonic.jpg)

where theta0 is the equilibrium value of the angle, and K is a
prefactor.  Note that the usual 1/2 factor is included in K.

The following coefficients must be defined for each angle type via the
"angle_coeff"_angle_coeff.html command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the "read_data"_read_data.html
or "read_restart"_read_restart.html commands:

K (energy/radian^2)
theta0 (degrees) :ul

Theta0 is specified in degrees, but LAMMPS converts it to radians
internally; hence the units of K are in energy/radian^2.

[Restrictions:] none

This angle style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
"molecular" package (which it is by default).  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info on packages.
