dump cac/initial/nodes command :h3

[Syntax:]

dump ID group-ID cac/initial/nodes N file args :pre

ID = user-assigned name for the dump
group-ID = ID of the group of atoms/elements to be dumped
cac/initial/nodes = style of dump command (other styles {atom} or {cfg} or {dcd} or {xtc} or {xyz} or {local} or {custom} are discussed on the "dump"_dump.html doc page)
N = dump every this many timesteps
file = name of file to write dump info to
args = same as arguments for "dump_style custom"_dump.html :ul

[Examples:]

dump initmesh all cac/initial/nodes 1 initial_CACmesh.txt

[Description:]

Generates a dump file containing the initial nodal positions of the simulated system. This is 
typically required as reference information to plot deformation contours and more. Since the information
is unchanging this is simply a mechanism to output the information in case the initial data file is 
not available or impractical; as such it only needs to be dumped once.


IMPORTANT NOTE: When restarting a CAC simulation the initial nodal
positions will not be nodal positions at the beginning of the restart run. 
They will be the nodal positions from the initial data file that was read or created
for that model in the first run.

NOTE: Unless the "dump_modify sort"_dump_modify.html option
is invoked, the atom and finite element information written to dump files will
be in an indeterminate order for each snapshot.
