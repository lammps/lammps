fix wall/stochastic command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID wall/stochastic reflectionstyle face pos temp velx vely velz accomx accomy accomz ... :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l

wall/stochastic = style name of this fix command :l

one or more face/arg pairs may be appended :l

reflectionstyle = diffusive or maxwell or cercignanilampis

face = {xlo} or {xhi} or {ylo} or {yhi} or {zlo} or {zhi} :l

  {xlo},{ylo},{zlo} pos = EDGE or constant 

    EDGE = current lo edge of simulation box

    constant = number like 0.0 or -30.0 (distance units)

    temp = wall temperature

    velx, vely, velz = wall velocity along x, y, z directions

    accomx, accomy, accomz = accommodation coefficients along x, y, z directions (only for maxwell and cercignanilampis reflection style)

  {xhi},{yhi},{zhi} pos = EDGE or constant or variable

    EDGE = current hi edge of simulation box

    constant = number like 50.0 or 100.3 (distance units)

    temp = wall temperature 

    velx, vely, velz = wall velocity along x, y, z directions

    accomx, accomy, accomz = accommodation coefficients along x, y, z directions (only for maxwell and cercignanilampis style)

    :pre

zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended :l keyword = {units} :l {units}
value = {lattice} or {box}

    {lattice} = the wall position is defined in lattice units

    {box} = the wall position is defined in simulation box units :pre

:ule

[Description:]

Different from the command fix wall/reflect which is equivalent to the mirror reflection, the post collision velocity of the atoms in the stochastic wall is random. The randomness can come from many sources: thermal motion of solid atoms, the surface roughness, etc... Three stochastic wall models are implemented. 

Diffusive wall (reflectionstyle = diffusive): all the gas atoms are reflected diffusively. Their velocity distribution corresponds to the equilibrium distribution at the wall temperature. 

Maxwell model (reflectionstyle = maxwell): the reflection is partially diffusive and partially specular. The accommodation coefficient is the portion of the diffusive reflection "Maxwell"_#Maxwell. 

Cercignani Lampis model: 3 accommodations coefficients are used, two velocity accommodation coefficients and one normal kinetic energy accommodation "CL"_#CL, "To"_#To. The code will recognize automatically the normal direction of the wall and the other two tangential directions. For example, if accomx = 0.5, accomy = 0.2, accomz = 0.3 and the wall is normal to direction y, accomx and accomz are the tangential velocity accommodation coefficients and accomy is the normal kinetic energy accommodation coefficients.

The {units} keyword determines the distance units used to define a wall position

A {box} value selects standard distance units as defined by the
"units"_units.html command, e.g. Angstroms for units = real or metal. 

A {lattice} value means the distance units are in lattice spacings. The
"lattice"_lattice.html command must have been previously used to define the
lattice spacings.

[Restrictions:]

Due to the similarities, this fix has the same limitation as the the
wall/reflect. Any dimension (xyz) that has a wall must be non-periodic. It
shoudld not be used with rigid bodies such as those defined by a "fix rigid"
command. Furthermore, the wall velocity must lie on the same plane as the wall. Package USER-MISC is required to use this fix.
