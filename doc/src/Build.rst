Build LAMMPS
============

LAMMPS is built as a library and an executable from source code using a
build environment generated by CMake (Unix Makefiles, Ninja, Xcode,
Visual Studio, KDevelop, CodeBlocks and more depending on the platform).
Using CMake is the preferred way to build LAMMPS.  In addition, LAMMPS
can be compiled using the legacy build system based on traditional
makefiles for use with GNU make (which may require manual editing).
Support for the legacy build system is slowly being phased out and may
not be available for all optional features.

As an alternative, you can download a package with pre-built executables
or automated build trees, as described in the :doc:`Install <Install>`
section of the manual.
