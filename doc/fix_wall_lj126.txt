fix wall/lj126 command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID wall/lj126 style coord epsilon sigma cutoff :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command
wall/lj126 = style name of this fix command
style = {xlo} or {xhi} or {ylo} or {yhi} or {zlo} or {zhi}
coord = position of wall
epsilon = Lennard-Jones epsilon for wall-particle interaction
sigma = Lennard-Jones sigma for wall-particle interaction
cutoff = distance from wall at which wall-particle interaction is cut off :ul

[Examples:]

fix wallhi all wall/lj126 xhi 10.0 1.0 1.0 1.12 :pre

[Description:]

Bound the simulation domain with a Lennard-Jones wall that encloses
the atoms.  The energy E of a wall-particle interactions is given by
the 12-6 potential

:c,image(Eqs/pair_lj.jpg)

where {r} is the distance from the particle to the wall {coord}, and
epsilon and sigma are the usual LJ parameters.  Rc is the cutoff value
specified in the command.  This interaction provides a harder, more
repulsive interaction with the wall than the softer 9-3 potential
provided by the "fix wall/lj93"_fix_wall_lj93.html command.

The wall potential is shifted so that the energy of a wall-particle
interaction is 0.0 at the cutoff distance.

This fix makes a contribution to the potential energy of the system
that can be included in thermodynamic output of potential energy using
the "fix_modify energy"_fix_modify.html option.  The contribution can
also be printed by itself via the keyword {f_fix-ID} in the
"thermo_style custom"_thermo_style.html command.

The forces due to this fix are also imposed during an energy
minimization, invoked by the "minimize"_minimize.html command.  If you
want that energy to be included in the total potential energy of the
system (the quantity being minimized), you must enable the
"fix_modify"_fix_modify.html {energy} option for this fix.
