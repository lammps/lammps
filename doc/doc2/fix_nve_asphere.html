<H3>fix nve/asphere command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>fix ID group-ID nve/asphere 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID, group-ID are documented in <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> command
<LI>nve/asphere = style name of this fix command 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>fix 1 all nve/asphere 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Perform constant NVE integration to update position, velocity,
orientation, and angular velocity for aspherical particles in the
group each timestep.  V is volume; E is energy.  This creates a system
trajectory consistent with the microcanonical ensemble.
</P>
<P>This fix differs from the <A HREF = "fix_nve.html">fix nve</A> command, which
assumes point particles and only updates their position and velocity.
</P>
<P><B>Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:</B>
</P>
<P>No information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.  None of the <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> options
are relevant to this fix.  No global or per-atom quantities are stored
by this fix for access by various <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_15">output
commands</A>.  No parameter of this fix can
be used with the <I>start/stop</I> keywords of the <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command.
This fix is not invoked during <A HREF = "minimize.html">energy minimization</A>.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B> 
</P>
<P>This fix is part of the ASPHERE package.  It is only enabled if LAMMPS
was built with that package.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info.
</P>
<P>This fix requires that atoms store torque and angular momementum and a
quaternion as defined by the <A HREF = "atom_style.html">atom_style ellipsoid</A>
command.
</P>
<P>All particles in the group must be finite-size.  They cannot be point
particles, but they can be aspherical or spherical as defined by their
shape attribute.
