The "oplsaa.lt" file contains force field parameters which we found in the
"oplsaa.prm" file which is distributed with TINKER.
Jay Ponder, (the author of TINKER) preferred that we do not distribute
that file with moltemplate.  However you can download that file here:

https://dasher.wustl.edu/tinker/distribution/params/oplsaa.prm

This directory does contain other files ("loplsaa.prm") containing additional
force field parameters that modify the original OPLSAA force field.
