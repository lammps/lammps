angle_style cosine/shift/exp command :h3

[Syntax:]

angle_style cosine/shift/exp :pre

[Examples:]

angle_style cosine/shift/exp
angle_coeff * 10.0 45.0 2.0 :pre

[Description:]

The {cosine/shift/exp} angle style uses the potential

:c,image(Eqs/angle_cosine/shift/exp.jpg)

where Umin, theta, and a are defined for each angle type.

The potential is bounded between \[-Umin:0\] and the minimum is
located at the angle theta0. The a parameter can be both positive or
negative and is used to control the spring constant at the
equilibrium.

The spring constant is given by k = A exp(A) Umin / \[2 (Exp(a)-1)\].
For a > 3, k/Umin = a/2 to better than 5% relative error. For negative
values of the a parameter, the spring constant is essentially zero,
and anharmonic terms takes over. The potential is furthermore well
behaved in the limit a -> 0, where it has been implemented to linear
order in a for a < 0.001. In this limit the potential reduces to the
cosineshifted potential.

The following coefficients must be defined for each angle type via the
"angle_coeff"_angle_coeff.html command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the "read_data"_read_data.html
or "read_restart"_read_restart.html commands:

umin (energy)
theta (angle)
A (real number) :ul

[Restrictions:]

This angle style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
"user-misc" package.  See the "Making LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#2_3
section for more info on packages.
