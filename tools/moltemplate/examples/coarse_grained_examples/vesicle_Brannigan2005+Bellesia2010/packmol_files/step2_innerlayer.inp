# NOTE: YOU MUST COMPLETE STEP 1 BEFORE RUNNING PACKMOL ON THIS FILE

# Step 2: Pack the lipids in the inner monolayer around the proteins from step1.
#
# ----- Run using: -----
# packmol < step2_innerlayer.inp
#    (This takes about 90 minutes on an Intel i7 processor)


# ----- Settings:  -----

# All the atoms from diferent molecules will be at least 5.5 Angstrons apart
tolerance 5.5
# (Setting "discale" to 1.4 increases the typical separation 
#  distance to approximately 1.4*5.5 = 7.7 Angstroms.)
discale 1.4
# The other parameters below are optional:
nloop 10000
maxit 20
seed 12345
sidemax 3000.0
# What fraction of the molecules are moved during "large moves"? (default 0.05)
movefrac 0.05
