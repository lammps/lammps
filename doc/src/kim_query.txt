kim_query command :h3

[Syntax:]

kim_query variable query_function web_query_flags :pre

variable = name of a (string style) variable where the result of the query is stored
query_function = name of the OpenKIM web API query function to be used
web_query_flags = a series of keyword=value pairs that represent the web query; supported keywords depend on query function :ul

[Examples:]

kim_query latconst get_test_result test=TE_156715955670 model=MO_800509458712 &
  prop=structure-cubic-crystal-npt species=\["Al"\] keys=\["a"\] units=\["angstrom"\] :pre

[Description:]

The kim_query command allows to retrieve properties from the OpenKIM
through a web query. The result is stored in a string style
"variable"_variable.html, the name of which must be given as the first
argument of the kim_query command. The second required argument is the
name of the actual query function (e.g. {get_test_result}). All following
arguments are parameters handed over to the web query in the format
{keyword=value}. This list of supported keywords and the type of how
the value has to be encoded depends on the query function used.
For more details on this, please refer to the OpenKIM homepage.

[Restrictions:]

This command is part of the KIM package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  Furthermore, its correct
functioning depends on compiling LAMMPS with libcurl support.
See the "Build package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.
