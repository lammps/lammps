pair_style tersoff command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style tersoff :pre

[Examples:]

pair_style tersoff
pair_coeff * * si.tersoff Si
pair_coeff * * SiC.tersoff Si C Si :pre

[Description:]

The {tersoff} style computes a 3-body "Tersoff"_#Tersoff potential
for the energy E of a system of atoms as

:c,image(Eqs/pair_tersoff.jpg)

where f_R is a two-body term and f_A includes three-body interactions.
The summations in the formula are over all neighbors J and K of atom I
within a cutoff distance = R + D.

Only a single pair_coeff command is used with the {tersoff} style
which specifies a Tersoff potential file with parameters for all
needed elements.  These are mapped to LAMMPS atom types by specifying
N additional arguments after the filename in the pair_coeff command,
where N is the number of LAMMPS atom types:

filename
N element names = mapping of Tersoff elements to atom types :ul

As an example, imagine the SiC.tersoff file has Tersoff values for Si
and C.  If your LAMMPS simulation has 4 atoms types and you want the
1st 3 to be Si, and the 4th to be C, you would use the following
pair_coeff command:

pair_coeff * * SiC.tersoff Si Si Si C :pre

The 1st 2 arguments must be * * so as to span all LAMMPS atom types.
The first three Si arguments map LAMMPS atom types 1,2,3 to the Si
element in the Tersoff file.  The final C argument maps LAMMPS atom
type 4 to the C element in the Tersoff file.  If a mapping value is
specified as NULL, the mapping is not performed.  This can be used
when a {tersoff} potential is used as part of the {hybrid} pair style.
The NULL values are placeholders for atom types that will be used with
other potentials.

Tersoff files in the {potentials} directory of the LAMMPS distribution
have a ".tersoff" suffix.  Lines that are not blank or comments
(starting with #) define parameters for a triplet of elements.  The
parameters in a single entry correspond to coefficients in the formula
above:

element 1 (the center atom in a 3-body interaction)
element 2 (the atom bonded to the center atom)
element 3 (the atom influencing the 1-2 bond in a bond-order sense)
lambda3 (1/distance units)
c
d
costheta0 (can be a value < -1 or > 1)
n
beta
lambda2 (1/distance units)
B (energy units)
R (distance units)
D (distance units)
lambda1 (1/distance units)
A (energy units) :ul

The n, beta, lambda2, B, R, D, lambda1, and A parameters are for
two-body interactions.  The lambda3, c, d, and costheta0 parameters
are for three-body interactions.  The non-annotated parameters are
unitless.

The Tersoff potential file must contain entries for all the elements
listed in the pair_coeff command.  It can also contain entries for
additional elements not being used in a particular simulation; LAMMPS
ignores those entries.

For a single-element simulation, only a single entry is required
(e.g. SiSiSi).  For a two-element simulation, the file must contain 8
entries (for SiSiSi, SiSiC, SiCSi, SiCC, CSiSi, CSiC, CCSi, CCC), that
specify Tersoff parameters for all permutations of the two elements
interacting in three-body configurations.  Thus for 3 elements, 27
entries would be required, etc.

As annotated above, the first element in the entry is the center atom
in a three-body interaction and it is bonded to the 2nd atom and the
bond is influenced by the 3rd atom.  Thus an entry for SiCC means Si
bonded to a C with another C atom influencing the bond.  Thus
three-body parameters for SiCSi and SiSiC entries will not, in
general, be the same.  Two-body parameters for an interaction come
from the entry where the 2nd element is repeated.  Thus the two-body
parameters for Si interacting with C, comes from the SiCC entry.  By
symmetry, the two-body parameters in the SiCC and CSiSi entries should
thus be the same.  Two-body parameters in entries whose 2nd and 3rd
element are different (e.g. SiCSi) are ignored.

[Restrictions:]

This pair potential requires the "newton"_newton.html setting to be
"on" for pair interactions.
