dihedral_style quadratic command :h3
dihedral_style quadratic/omp command :h3

[Syntax:]

dihedral_style quadratic :pre

[Examples:]

dihedral_style quadratic
dihedral_coeff 100.0 80.0 :pre

[Description:]

The {quadratic} dihedral style uses the potential:

:c,image(Eqs/dihedral_quadratic.jpg)

This dihedral potential can be used to keep a dihedral in a predefined
value (cis=zero, right-hand convention is used).

The following coefficients must be defined for each dihedral type via
the "dihedral_coeff"_dihedral_coeff.html command as in the example
above, or in the data file or restart files read by the
"read_data"_read_data.html or "read_restart"_read_restart.html
commands:

K (energy/radian^2) 
phi0 (degrees) :ul

:line

Styles with a {cuda}, {gpu}, {omp}, or {opt} suffix are functionally
the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.  They have
been optimized to run faster, depending on your available hardware, as
discussed in "Section_accelerate"_Section_accelerate.html of the
manual.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and should
produce the same results, except for round-off and precision issues.

These accelerated styles are part of the USER-CUDA, GPU, USER-OMP and
OPT packages, respectively.  They are only enabled if LAMMPS was built
with those packages.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info.

You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the "-suffix command-line
switch"_Section_start.html#start_7 when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can
use the "suffix"_suffix.html command in your input script.

See "Section_accelerate"_Section_accelerate.html of the manual for
more instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.

[Restrictions:]

This angle style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
USER_MISC package.  See the "Making LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 
section for more info on packages.
