4. Packages :h3

This section gives an overview of the add-on optional packages that
extend LAMMPS functionality.  Packages are groups of files that enable
a specific set of features.  For example, force fields for molecular
systems or granular systems are in packages.  You can see the list of
all packages by typing "make package" from within the src directory of
the LAMMPS distribution.

Here are links for two tables below, which list standard and user
packages.

4.1 "Standard packages"_#pkg_1
4.2 "User packages"_#pkg_2 :all(b)

"Section 2.3"_Section_start.html#start_3 of the manual describes
the difference between standard packages and user packages.  It also
has general details on how to include/exclude specific packages as
part of the LAMMPS build process, and on how to build auxiliary
libraries or modify a machine Makefile if a package requires it.

Following the two tables below, is a sub-section for each package.  It
has a summary of what the package contains.  It has specific
instructions on how to install it, build or obtain any auxiliary
library it requires, and any Makefile.machine changes it requires.  It
also lists pointers to examples of its use or documentation provided
in the LAMMPS distribution.  If you want to know the complete list of
commands that a package adds to LAMMPS, simply list the files in its
directory, e.g. "ls src/GRANULAR".  Source files with names that start
with compute, fix, pair, bond, etc correspond to command styles with
the same names.

NOTE: The USER package sub-sections below are still being filled in,
as of March 2016.

Unless otherwise noted below, every package is independent of all the
others.  I.e. any package can be included or excluded in a LAMMPS
build, independent of all other packages.  However, note that some
packages include commands derived from commands in other packages.  If
the other package is not installed, the derived command from the new
package will also not be installed when you include the new one.
E.g. the pair lj/cut/coul/long/omp command from the USER-OMP package
will not be installed as part of the USER-OMP package if the KSPACE
package is not also installed, since it contains the pair
lj/cut/coul/long command.  If you later install the KSPACE package and
the USER-OMP package is already installed, both the pair
lj/cut/coul/long and lj/cut/coul/long/omp commands will be installed.

The "Authors" column lists a name(s) if a specific person is
responsible for creating and maintaining the package.

(1) The COLLOID package includes Fast Lubrication Dynamics pair styles
which were created by Amit Kumar and Michael Bybee from Jonathan
Higdon's group at UIUC.

(2) The OPT package was created by James Fischer (High Performance
Technologies), David Richie, and Vincent Natoli (Stone Ridge
Technolgy).

(3) The KIM package was created by Valeriu Smirichinski, Ryan Elliott,
and Ellad Tadmor (U Minn).

(4) The KOKKOS package was created primarily by Christian Trott and
Stan Moore (Sandia).  It uses the Kokkos library which was developed
by Carter Edwards, Christian Trott, and others at Sandia.

The "Doc page" column links to either a sub-section of the
"Section 6"_Section_howto.html of the manual, or an input script
command implemented as part of the package, or to additional
documentation provided within the package.

The "Example" column is a sub-directory in the examples directory of
the distribution which has an input script that uses the package.
E.g. "peptide" refers to the examples/peptide directory.

The "Library" column lists an external library which must be built
first and which LAMMPS links to when it is built.  If it is listed as
lib/package, then the code for the library is under the lib directory
of the LAMMPS distribution.  See the lib/package/README file for info
on how to build the library.  If it is not listed as lib/package, then
it is a third-party library not included in the LAMMPS distribution.
See details on all of this below for individual packages.

Contents: Support for compressed output of dump files via the zlib
compression library, using dump styles with a "gz" in their style
name.

Building with the COMPRESS package assumes you have the zlib
compression library available on your system.  The build uses the
lib/compress/Makefile.lammps file in the compile/link process.  You
should only need to edit this file if the LAMMPS build cannot find the
zlib info it specifies.

:line

GPU package :link(GPU),h5

Contents: Dozens of pair styles and a version of the PPPM long-range
Coulombic solver for NVIDIA GPUs.  All of them have a "gpu" in their
style name.  "Section 5.3.1"_accelerate_gpu.html gives
details of what hardware and Cuda software is required on your system,
and how to build and use this package.  See the KOKKOS package, which
also has GPU-enabled styles.

Building LAMMPS with the GPU package requires first building the GPU
library itself, which is a set of C and Cuda files in lib/gpu.
Details of how to do this are in lib/gpu/README.  As illustrated
below, perform a "make" using one of the Makefile.machine files in
lib/gpu which should create a lib/reax/libgpu.a file.
Makefile.linux.* and Makefile.xk7 are examples for different
platforms.  There are 3 important settings in the Makefile.machine you
use:

CUDA_HOME = where NVIDIA Cuda software is installed on your system
CUDA_ARCH = appropriate to your GPU hardware
CUDA_PREC = precision (double, mixed, single) you desire :ul

See example Makefile.machine files in lib/gpu for the syntax of these
settings.  See lib/gpu/Makefile.linux.double for ARCH settings for
various NVIDIA GPUs.  The "make" also creates a
lib/gpu/Makefile.lammps file.  This file has settings that enable
LAMMPS to link with Cuda libraries.  If the settings in
Makefile.lammps for your machine are not correct, the LAMMPS link will
fail.  Note that the Make.py script has a "-gpu" option to allow the
GPU library (with several of its options) and LAMMPS to be built in
one step, with Type "python src/Make.py -h -gpu" to see the details.

To install via make or Make.py:

cd ~/lammps/lib/gpu
make -f Makefile.linux.mixed     # for example
cd ~/lammps/src
make yes-gpu
make machine :pre

KIM package :link(KIM),h5

Contents: A pair style that interfaces to the Knowledge Base for
Interatomic Models (KIM) repository of interatomic potentials, so that
KIM potentials can be used in a LAMMPS simulation.

To build LAMMPS with the KIM package you must have previously
installed the KIM API (library) on your system.  The lib/kim/README
file explains how to download and install KIM.  Building with the KIM
package also uses the lib/kim/Makefile.lammps file in the compile/link
process.  You should not need to edit this file.

To install via make or Make.py:

make yes-kim
make machine :pre

Make.py -p kim -a machine :pre

To un-install via make or Make.py:

make no-kim

:line

KOKKOS package :link(KOKKOS),h5

Contents: Dozens of atom, pair, bond, angle, dihedral, improper styles
which run with the Kokkos library to provide optimization for
multicore CPUs (via OpenMP), NVIDIA GPUs, or the Intel Xeon Phi (in
native mode).  All of them have a "kk" in their style name.  "Section
5.3.3"_accelerate_kokkos.html gives details of what
hardware and software is required on your system, and how to build and
use this package.  See the GPU, OPT, USER-INTEL, USER-OMP packages,
which also provide optimizations for the same range of hardware.

Building with the KOKKOS package requires choosing which of 3 hardware
options you are optimizing for: CPU acceleration via OpenMP, GPU
acceleration, or Intel Xeon Phi.  (You can build multiple times to
create LAMMPS executables for different hardware.)  It also requires a
C++11 compatible compiler.  For GPUs, the NVIDIA "nvcc" compiler is
used, and an appropriate KOKKOS_ARCH setting should be made in your
Makefile.machine for your GPU hardware and NVIDIA software.

The simplest way to do this is to use Makefile.kokkos_cuda or
Makefile.kokkos_omp or Makefile.kokkos_phi in src/MAKE/OPTIONS, via
"make kokkos_cuda" or "make kokkos_omp" or "make kokkos_phi".  (Check
the KOKKOS_ARCH setting in Makefile.kokkos_cuda), Or, as illustrated
below, you can use the Make.py script with its "-kokkos" option to
choose which hardware to build for.  Type "python src/Make.py -h
-kokkos" to see the details.  If these methods do not work on your
system, you will need to read the "Section 5.3.3"_accelerate_kokkos.html
doc page for details of what Makefile.machine settings are needed.

To install via make or Make.py for each of 3 hardware options:

make yes-kokkos
make kokkos_omp    # for CPUs with OpenMP
make kokkos_cuda   # for GPUs, check the KOKKOS_ARCH setting in Makefile.kokkos_cuda
make kokkos_phi    # for Xeon Phis :pre

Make.py -p kokkos -kokkos omp -a machine           # for CPUs with OpenMP
Make.py -p kokkos -kokkos cuda arch=35 -a machine  # for GPUs of style arch

KSPACE package :link(KSPACE),h5

Contents: A variety of long-range Coulombic solvers, and pair styles
which compute the corresponding short-range portion of the pairwise
Coulombic interactions.  These include Ewald, particle-particle
particle-mesh (PPPM), and multilevel summation method (MSM) solvers.

Building with the KSPACE package requires a 1d FFT library be present
on your system for use by the PPPM solvers.  This can be the KISS FFT
library provided with LAMMPS, or 3rd party libraries like FFTW or a
vendor-supplied FFT library.  See step 6 of "Section
2.2.2"_Section_start.html#start_2_2 of the manual for details of how
to select different FFT options in your machine Makefile.  The Make.py
tool has an "-fft" option which can insert these settings into your
machine Makefile automatically.  Type "python src/Make.py -h -fft" to
see the details.

MEAM package :link(MEAM),h5

Contents: A pair style for the modified embedded atom (MEAM)
potential.

Building LAMMPS with the MEAM package requires first building the MEAM
library itself, which is a set of Fortran 95 files in lib/meam.
Details of how to do this are in lib/meam/README.  As illustrated
below, perform a "make" using one of the Makefile.machine files in
lib/meam which should create a lib/meam/libmeam.a file.
Makefile.gfortran and Makefile.ifort are examples for the GNU Fortran
and Intel Fortran compilers.  The "make" also copies a
lib/meam/Makefile.lammps.machine file to lib/meam/Makefile.lammps.
This file has settings that enable the C++ compiler used to build
LAMMPS to link with a Fortran library (typically the 2 compilers to be
consistent e.g. both Intel compilers, or both GNU compilers).  If the
settings in Makefile.lammps for your compilers and machine are not
correct, the LAMMPS link will fail.  Note that the Make.py script has
a "-meam" option to allow the MEAM library and LAMMPS to be built in
one step.  Type "python src/Make.py -h -meam" to see the details.

NOTE: The MEAM potential can run dramatically faster if built with the
Intel Fortran compiler, rather than the GNU Fortran compiler.

use this package.  See the KOKKOS, USER-INTEL, and USER-OMP packages,
which also have styles optimized for CPU performance.

Some C++ compilers, like the Intel compiler, require the compile flag
"-restrict" to build LAMMPS with the OPT package.  It should be added
to the CCFLAGS line of your Makefile.machine.  Or use Makefile.opt in
src/MAKE/OPTIONS, via "make opt".  For compilers that use the flag,
the Make.py command adds it automatically to the Makefile.auto file it
creates and uses.

To install via make or Make.py:

make yes-opt
make machine :pre

Make.py -p opt -a machine :pre

To un-install via make or Make.py:

make no-opt

POEMS package :link(POEMS),h5

Contents: A fix that wraps the Parallelizable Open source Efficient
Multibody Software (POEMS) librar, which is able to simulate the
dynamics of articulated body systems.  These are systems with multiple
rigid bodies (collections of atoms or particles) whose motion is
coupled by connections at hinge points.

Building LAMMPS with the POEMS package requires first building the
POEMS library itself, which is a set of C++ files in lib/poems.
Details of how to do this are in lib/poems/README.  As illustrated
below, perform a "make" using one of the Makefile.machine files in
lib/poems which should create a lib/meam/libpoems.a file.
Makefile.g++ and Makefile.icc are examples for the GNU and Intel C++
compilers.  The "make" also creates a lib/poems/Makefile.lammps file
which you should not need to change.  Note the Make.py script has a
"-poems" option to allow the POEMS library and LAMMPS to be built in
one step.  Type "python src/Make.py -h -poems" to see the details.

To install via make or Make.py:

cd ~/lammps/lib/poems
make -f Makefile.g++    # for example
cd ~/lammps/src
make yes-poems
make machine :pre

Make.py -p poems -poems make=g++ -a machine :pre

PYTHON package :link(PYTHON),h5

Contents: A "python"_python.html command which allow you to execute
Python code from a LAMMPS input script.  The code can be in a separate
file or embedded in the input script itself.  See "Section
11.2"_Section_python.html#py_2 for an overview of using Python from
LAMMPS and for other ways to use LAMMPS and Python together.

Building with the PYTHON package assumes you have a Python shared
library available on your system, which needs to be a Python 2
version, 2.6 or later.  Python 3 is not yet supported.  The build uses
the contents of the lib/python/Makefile.lammps file to find all the Python
files required in the build/link process.  See the lib/python/README
file if the settings in that file do not work on your system.  Note
that the Make.py script has a "-python" option to allow an alternate
lib/python/Makefile.lammps file to be specified and LAMMPS to be built
in one step.  Type "python src/Make.py -h -python" to see the details.

To install via make or Make.py:

make yes-python

REAX package :link(REAX),h5

Contents: A pair style for the ReaxFF potential, a universal reactive
force field, as well as a "fix reax/bonds"_fix_reax_bonds.html command
for monitoring molecules as bonds are created and destroyed.

Building LAMMPS with the REAX package requires first building the REAX
library itself, which is a set of Fortran 95 files in lib/reax.
Details of how to do this are in lib/reax/README.  As illustrated
below, perform a "make" using one of the Makefile.machine files in
lib/reax which should create a lib/reax/libreax.a file.
Makefile.gfortran and Makefile.ifort are examples for the GNU Fortran
and Intel Fortran compilers.  The "make" also copies a
lib/reax/Makefile.lammps.machine file to lib/reax/Makefile.lammps.
This file has settings that enable the C++ compiler used to build
LAMMPS to link with a Fortran library (typically the 2 compilers to be
consistent e.g. both Intel compilers, or both GNU compilers).  If the
settings in Makefile.lammps for your compilers and machine are not
correct, the LAMMPS link will fail.  Note that the Make.py script has
a "-reax" option to allow the REAX library and LAMMPS to be built in
one step.  Type "python src/Make.py -h -reax" to see the details.

To install via make or Make.py:

cd ~/lammps/lib/reax
make -f Makefile.gfortran    # for example
cd ~/lammps/src

REPLICA package :link(REPLICA),h5

Contents: A collection of multi-replica methods that are used by
invoking multiple instances (replicas) of LAMMPS
simulations. Communication between individual replicas is performed in
different ways by the different methods.  See "Section
6.5"_Section_howto.html#howto_5 for an overview of how to run
multi-replica simulations in LAMMPS.  Multi-replica methods included
in the package are nudged elastic band (NEB), parallel replica
dynamics (PRD), temperature accelerated dynamics (TAD), parallel
tempering, and a verlet/split algorithm for performing long-range
Coulombics on one set of processors, and the remainder of the force

To build LAMMPS with the KIM package you must have previously
installed the KIM API (library) on your system.  The lib/kim/README
file explains how to download and install KIM.  Building with the KIM
package also uses the lib/kim/Makefile.lammps file in the compile/link
process.  You should not need to edit this file.


To build LAMMPS with the VORONOI package you must have previously
installed the Voro++ library on your system.  The lib/voronoi/README
file explains how to download and install Voro++.  There is a
lib/voronoi/install.py script which automates the process.  Type
"python install.py" to see instructions.  The final step is to create
soft links in the lib/voronoi directory for "includelink" and
"liblink" which point to installed Voro++ directories.  Building with
the VORONOI package uses the contents of the
lib/voronoi/Makefile.lammps file in the compile/link process.  You
should not need to edit this file.  Note that the Make.py script has a
"-voronoi" option to allow the Voro++ library to be downloaded and/or
installed and LAMMPS to be built in one step.  Type "python
src/Make.py -h -voronoi" to see the details.

For the USER-INTEL package, you have 2 choices when building.  You can
build with CPU or Phi support.  The latter uses Xeon Phi chips in
"offload" mode.  Each of these modes requires additional settings in
your Makefile.machine for CCFLAGS and LINKFLAGS.

For CPU mode (if using an Intel compiler):

CCFLAGS: add -fopenmp, -DLAMMPS_MEMALIGN=64, -restrict, -xHost, -fno-alias, -ansi-alias, -override-limits
LINKFLAGS: add -fopenmp :ul

For Phi mode add the following in addition to the CPU mode flags:

CCFLAGS: add -DLMP_INTEL_OFFLOAD and
LINKFLAGS: add -offload :ul

And also add this to CCFLAGS:

-offload-option,mic,compiler,"-fp-model fast=2 -mGLOB_default_function_attrs=\"gather_scatter_loop_unroll=4\"" :pre

USER-MGPT package :link(USER-MGPT),h5

Supporting info:

This package contains a fast implementation for LAMMPS of
quantum-based MGPT multi-ion potentials.  The MGPT or model GPT method
derives from first-principles DFT-based generalized pseudopotential
theory (GPT) through a series of systematic approximations valid for
mid-period transition metals with nearly half-filled d bands.  The
MGPT method was originally developed by John Moriarty at Lawrence
Livermore National Lab (LLNL).

In the general matrix representation of MGPT, which can also be
applied to f-band actinide metals, the multi-ion potentials are
evaluated on the fly during a simulation through d- or f-state matrix
multiplication, and the forces that move the ions are determined
analytically.  The {mgpt} pair style in this package calculates forces
and energies using an optimized matrix-MGPT algorithm due to Tomas
Oppelstrup at LLNL.

See this doc page to get started:

"pair_style mgpt"_pair_mgpt.html

USER-MANIFOLD package :link(USER-MANIFOLD),h5

Supporting info:

This package contains a dump molfile command which uses molfile
plugins that are bundled with the
"VMD"_http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd molecular visualization and
analysis program, to enable LAMMPS to dump its information in formats
compatible with various molecular simulation tools.

This package allows LAMMPS to perform MD simulations of particles
constrained on a manifold (i.e., a 2D subspace of the 3D simulation
box). It achieves this using the RATTLE constraint algorithm applied
to single-particle constraint functions g(xi,yi,zi) = 0 and their
derivative (i.e. the normal of the manifold) n = grad(g).

See this doc page to get started:

"fix manifoldforce"_fix_manifoldforce.html

USER-MOLFILE package :link(USER-MOLFILE),h5

Supporting info:

This package contains a dump molfile command which uses molfile
plugins that are bundled with the
"VMD"_http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd molecular visualization and
analysis program, to enable LAMMPS to dump its information in formats
compatible with various molecular simulation tools.

The package only provides the interface code, not the plugins.  These
can be obtained from a VMD installation which has to match the
platform that you are using to compile LAMMPS for. By adding plugins
to VMD, support for new file formats can be added to LAMMPS (or VMD or
other programs that use them) without having to recompile the
application itself.

USER-QMMM package :link(USER-QMMM),h5

Supporting info:

This package provides a fix qmmm command which allows LAMMPS to be
used in a QM/MM simulation, currently only in combination with pw.x
code from the "Quantum ESPRESSO"_espresso package.

:link(espresso,http://www.quantum-espresso.org)

The current implementation only supports an ONIOM style mechanical
coupling to the Quantum ESPRESSO plane wave DFT package.
Electrostatic coupling is in preparation and the interface has been
written in a manner that coupling to other QM codes should be possible
without changes to LAMMPS itself.

USER-QTB package :link(USER-QTB),h5

Supporting info:

This package provides a self-consistent quantum treatment of the
vibrational modes in a classical molecular dynamics simulation.  By
coupling the MD simulation to a colored thermostat, it introduces zero
point energy into the system, alter the energy power spectrum and the
heat capacity towards their quantum nature. This package could be of
interest if one wants to model systems at temperatures lower than
their classical limits or when temperatures ramp up across the
classical limits in the simulation.

See these two doc pages to get started:

"fix qtb"_fix_qtb.html provides quantum nulcear correction through a
colored thermostat and can be used with other time integration schemes
like "fix nve"_fix_nve.html or "fix nph"_fix_nh.html.

"fix qbmsst"_fix_qbmsst.html enables quantum nuclear correction of a
multi-scale shock technique simulation by coupling the quantum thermal
bath with the shocked system.

USER-REAXC package :link(USER-REAXC),h5

Supporting info:

This package contains a implementation for LAMMPS of the ReaxFF force
field.  ReaxFF uses distance-dependent bond-order functions to
represent the contributions of chemical bonding to the potential
energy.  It was originally developed by Adri van Duin and the Goddard
group at CalTech.

The USER-REAXC version of ReaxFF (pair_style reax/c), implemented in
C, should give identical or very similar results to pair_style reax,
which is a ReaxFF implementation on top of a Fortran library, a
version of which library was originally authored by Adri van Duin.

The reax/c version should be somewhat faster and more scalable,
particularly with respect to the charge equilibration calculation.  It
should also be easier to build and use since there are no complicating
issues with Fortran memory allocation or linking to a Fortran library.

For technical details about this implementation of ReaxFF, see
this paper:

Parallel and Scalable Reactive Molecular Dynamics: Numerical Methods
and Algorithmic Techniques, H. M. Aktulga, J. C. Fogarty,
S. A. Pandit, A. Y. Grama, Parallel Computing, in press (2011).

See the doc page for the pair_style reax/c command for details
of how to use it in LAMMPS.
