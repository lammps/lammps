pair_style born command :h3
pair_style born/coul/long command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style style args :pre

style = {born} or {born/coul/long}
args = list of arguments for a particular style :ul
  {born} args = cutoff
    cutoff = global cutoff for non-Coulombic interactions (distance units)
  {born/coul/long} args = cutoff (cutoff2)
    cutoff = global cutoff for non-Coulombic (and Coulombic if only 1 arg) (distance units)
    cutoff2 = global cutoff for Coulombic (optional) (distance units) :pre

[Examples:]

pair_style born 10.0
pair_coeff * * 6.08 0.317 2.340 24.18 11.51
pair_coeff 1 1 6.08 0.317 2.340 24.18 11.51 :pre

pair_style born/coul/long 10.0
pair_style born/coul/long 10.0 8.0
pair_coeff * * 6.08 0.317 2.340 24.18 11.51
pair_coeff 1 1 6.08 0.317 2.340 24.18 11.51 :pre

[Description:]

The {born} style computes the Born-Mayer-Huggins or Tosi/Fumi
potential described in "(Fumi and Tosi)"_#FumiTosi, given by

:c,image(Eqs/pair_born.jpg)

where sigma is an interaction-dependent length parameter, rho is an
ionic-pair dependent length parameter, and Rc is the cutoff.

The {born/coul/long} style adds a Coulombic term as described for the
"lj/cut"_pair_lj.html pair styles.  An additional damping factor is
applied to the Coulombic term so it can be used in conjunction with
the "kspace_style"_kspace_style.html command and its {ewald} or {pppm}
option.  The Coulombic cutoff specified for this style means that
pairwise interactions within this distance are computed directly;
interactions outside that distance are computed in reciprocal space.

If one cutoff is specified for the {born/coulk/long} style, it is used
for both the A,C,D and Coulombic terms.  If two cutoffs are specified,
the first is used as the cutoff for the A,C,D terms, and the second is
the cutoff for the Coulombic term.

Note that these potentials are related to the "Buckingham
potential"_pair_born.html.

The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atoms
types via the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command as in the examples
above, or in the data file or restart files read by the
"read_data"_read_data.html or "read_restart"_read_restart.html
commands, or by mixing as described below:

A (energy units)
rho (distance units)
sigma (distance units)
C (energy units * distance units^6)
D (energy units * distance units^8)
cutoff (distance units) :ul

The second coefficient, rho, must be greater than zero.

The last coefficient is optional.  If not specified, the global A,C,D
cutoff specified in the pair_style command is used.

For {buck/coul/long} no Coulombic cutoff can be specified for an
individual I,J type pair.  All type pairs use the same global
Coulombic cutoff specified in the pair_style command.

[Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info]:

These pair styles do not support mixing.  Thus, coefficients for all
I,J pairs must be specified explicitly.

These styles support the "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html shift option
for the energy of the exp(), 1/r^6, and 1/r^8 portion of the pair
interaction.

The {born/coul/long} pair style does not support the
"pair_modify"_pair_modify.html table option since a tabulation
capability has not yet been added to this potential.

These styles support the pair_modify tail option for adding long-range
tail corrections to energy and pressure.

Thess styles writes thei information to binary "restart"_restart.html
files, so pair_style and pair_coeff commands do not need to be
specified in an input script that reads a restart file.

These styles can only be used via the {pair} keyword of the "run_style
respa"_run_style.html command.  They do not support the {inner},
{middle}, {outer} keywords.

[Restrictions:]

The {born/coul/long} style is part of the "kspace" package.  It is
only enabled if LAMMPS was built with that package (which it is by
default).  See the "Making LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#2_3 section for
more info.

[Default:] none
