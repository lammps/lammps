Description
"""""""""""

The *hbond/dreiding* styles compute the Acceptor-Hydrogen-Donor (AHD)
3-body hydrogen bond interaction for the :doc:`DREIDING <Howto_bioFF>`
force field, given by:

.. math::

   E  = & \left[LJ(r) | Morse(r) \right] \qquad \qquad \qquad r < r_{\rm in} \\
      = & S(r) * \left[LJ(r) | Morse(r) \right] \qquad \qquad r_{\rm in} < r < r_{\rm out} \\
      = & 0 \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad r > r_{\rm out} \\
   LJ(r)  = & AR^{-12}-BR^{-10}cos^n\theta=
         \epsilon\left\lbrace 5\left[ \frac{\sigma}{r}\right]^{12}-
         6\left[ \frac{\sigma}{r}\right]^{10}  \right\rbrace cos^n\theta\\
   Morse(r)  = & D_0\left\lbrace \chi^2 - 2\chi\right\rbrace cos^n\theta=
         D_{0}\left\lbrace e^{- 2 \alpha (r - r_0)} - 2 e^{- \alpha (r - r_0)}
         \right\rbrace cos^n\theta \\
   S(r)  = & \frac{ \left[r_{\rm out}^2 - r^2\right]^2
   \left[r_{\rm out}^2 + 2r^2 - 3{r_{\rm in}^2}\right]}
   { \left[r_{\rm out}^2 - {r_{\rm in}}^2\right]^3 }

where :math:`r_{\rm in}` is the inner spline distance cutoff,
:math:`r_{\rm out}` is the outer distance cutoff, :math:`\theta_c` is
the angle cutoff, and :math:`n` is the power of the cosine of the angle
:math:`\theta`.

Here, *r* is the radial distance between the donor (D) and acceptor
(A) atoms and :math:`\theta` is the bond angle between the acceptor, the
hydrogen (H) and the donor atoms:

   :align: center

These 3-body interactions can be defined for pairs of acceptor and
donor atoms, based on atom types.  For each donor/acceptor atom pair,
the third atom in the interaction is a hydrogen permanently bonded to
the donor atom, e.g. in a bond list read in from a data file via the
:doc:`read_data <read_data>` command.  The atom types of possible
hydrogen atoms for each donor/acceptor type pair are specified by the
:doc:`pair_coeff <pair_coeff>` command (see below).

Style *hbond/dreiding/lj* is the original DREIDING potential of
:ref:`(Mayo) <pair-Mayo>`.  It uses a LJ 12/10 functional for the Donor-Acceptor
interactions. To match the results in the original paper, use n = 4.

Style *hbond/dreiding/morse* is an improved version using a Morse
potential for the Donor-Acceptor interactions. :ref:`(Liu) <Liu>` showed
that the Morse form gives improved results for Dendrimer simulations,
when n = 2.

See the :doc:`Howto bioFF <Howto_bioFF>` page for more information
on the DREIDING force field.

.. note::

   Because the Dreiding hydrogen bond potential is only one portion
   of an overall force field which typically includes other pairwise
   interactions, it is common to use it as a sub-style in a :doc:`pair_style hybrid/overlay <pair_hybrid>` command, where another pair style
   provides the repulsive core interaction between pairs of atoms, e.g. a
   1/r\^12 Lennard-Jones repulsion.

.. note::

   When using the hbond/dreiding pair styles with :doc:`pair_style hybrid/overlay <pair_hybrid>`, you should explicitly define pair
   interactions between the donor atom and acceptor atoms, (as well as
   between these atoms and ALL other atoms in your system).  Whenever
   :doc:`pair_style hybrid/overlay <pair_hybrid>` is used, ordinary mixing
   rules are not applied to atoms like the donor and acceptor atoms
   because they are typically referenced in multiple pair styles.
   Neglecting to do this can cause difficult-to-detect physics problems.

.. note::

   In the original Dreiding force field paper 1-4 non-bonded
   interactions ARE allowed.  If this is desired for your model, use the
   special_bonds command (e.g. "special_bonds lj 0.0 0.0 1.0") to turn
   these interactions on.

----------

The following coefficients must be defined for pairs of eligible
donor/acceptor types via the :doc:`pair_coeff <pair_coeff>` command as
in the examples above.

.. note::

   Unlike other pair styles and their associated
   :doc:`pair_coeff <pair_coeff>` commands, you do not need to specify
   pair_coeff settings for all possible I,J type pairs.  Only I,J type
   pairs for atoms which act as joint donors/acceptors need to be
   specified; all other type pairs are assumed to be inactive.

.. note::

   A :doc:`pair_coeff <pair_coeff>` command can be specified multiple
   times for the same donor/acceptor type pair.  This enables multiple
   hydrogen types to be assigned to the same donor/acceptor type pair.
   For other pair_styles, if the pair_coeff command is re-used for the
   same I.J type pair, the settings for that type pair are overwritten.
   For the hydrogen bond potentials this is not the case; the settings
   are cumulative.  This means the only way to turn off a previous
   setting, is to re-use the pair_style command and start over.

For the *hbond/dreiding/lj* style the list of coefficients is as
follows:

* K = hydrogen atom type = 1 to Ntypes, or type label
* donor flag = *i* or *j*
* :math:`\epsilon` (energy units)
* :math:`\sigma` (distance units)
* *n* = exponent in formula above
* distance cutoff :math:`r_{\rm in}` (distance units)
* distance cutoff :math:`r_{\rm out}` (distance units)
* angle cutoff (degrees)

For the *hbond/dreiding/morse* style the list of coefficients is as
follows:

* K = hydrogen atom type = 1 to Ntypes, or type label
* donor flag = *i* or *j*
* :math:`D_0` (energy units)
* :math:`\alpha` (1/distance units)
* :math:`r_0` (distance units)
* *n* = exponent in formula above
* distance cutoff :math:`r_{\rm in}` (distance units)
* distance cutoff :math:`r_{out}` (distance units)
* angle cutoff (degrees)

A single hydrogen atom type K can be specified, or a wild-card asterisk
can be used in place of or in conjunction with the K arguments to
select multiple types as hydrogen atoms.  This takes the form
"\*" or "\*n" or "n\*" or "m\*n".  See the :doc:`pair_coeff <pair_coeff>`
command page for details.

If the donor flag is *i*, then the atom of type I in the pair_coeff
command is treated as the donor, and J is the acceptor.  If the donor
flag is *j*, then the atom of type J in the pair_coeff command is
treated as the donor and I is the donor.  This option is required
because the :doc:`pair_coeff <pair_coeff>` command requires that I <= J.

:math:`\epsilon` and :math:`\sigma` are settings for the hydrogen bond
potential based on a Lennard-Jones functional form.  Note that sigma is
defined as the zero-crossing distance for the potential, not as the
energy minimum at :math:`2^{1/6} \sigma`.

:math:`D_0` and :math:`\alpha` and :math:`r_0` are settings for the
hydrogen bond potential based on a Morse functional form.

The last 3 coefficients for both styles are optional.  If not
specified, the global n, distance cutoff, and angle cutoff specified
in the pair_style command are used.  If you wish to only override the
second or third optional parameter, you must also specify the preceding
optional parameters.

Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

These pair styles do not support mixing. You must explicitly identify
each donor/acceptor type pair.

These styles do not support the :doc:`pair_modify <pair_modify>` shift
option for the energy of the interactions.

The :doc:`pair_modify <pair_modify>` table option is not relevant for
these pair styles.

These pair styles do not support the :doc:`pair_modify <pair_modify>`
tail option for adding long-range tail corrections to energy and
pressure.

These pair styles do not write their information to :doc:`binary restart
files <restart>`, so pair_style and pair_coeff commands need to be
re-specified in an input script that reads a restart file.

These pair styles can only be used via the *pair* keyword of the
:doc:`run_style respa <run_style>` command.  They do not support the
*inner*, *middle*, *outer* keywords.

These pair styles tally a count of how many hydrogen bonding
interactions they calculate each timestep and the hbond energy.  These
quantities can be accessed via the :doc:`compute pair <compute_pair>`
command as a vector of values of length 2.

To print these quantities to the log file (with a descriptive column
heading) the following commands could be included in an input script:

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   compute hb all pair hbond/dreiding/lj
   variable n_hbond equal c_hb[1] #number hbonds
   variable E_hbond equal c_hb[2] #hbond energy
   thermo_style custom step temp epair v_E_hbond

This pair style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
MOLECULE package.  See the :doc:`Build package <Build_package>` doc page
for more info.
