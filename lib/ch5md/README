ch5md : Read and write H5MD files in C
======================================

Copyright (C) 2013-2014 Pierre de Buyl

ch5md is a set of C routines to manipulate H5MD files. H5MD is a file format
specification based on [HDF5](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/) for storing
molecular data, whose development is found at <http://nongnu.org/h5md/>.

ch5md is developped by Pierre de Buyl and is released under the 3-clause BSD
license that can be found in the file LICENSE.

To use the h5md dump style in lammps, execute make in this directory then 'make
yes-user-h5md' in the src directory of lammps. Rebuild lammps. 

If HDF5 is not in a standard system location, use `make HDF5_PATH=/path/to/hdf5`.
