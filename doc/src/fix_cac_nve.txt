fix cac/nve command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID cac/nve :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command
cac/nve = style name of this fix command :ul

[Examples:]

fix 1 all cac/nve :pre

[Description:]

Perform constant NVE integration to update position and velocity for
atoms and finite elements in the group each timestep. Note that there
is currently no formal reason to believe that this conserves energy 
for the CAC method; it is however free of external input that would supposedly
perturb the energy of the system.
