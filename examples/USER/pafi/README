PAFI performs constrained force averages on hyperplanes to a reference pathway in order to compute unbiased free energy barriers

Also see https://github.com/tomswinburne/pafi/ for PAFI++ code which uses the USER-PAFI package when loading LAMMPS as a C++ library

To run example:

mpirun -np NUMPROCS lmp_machine < in.lammps

where NUMPROCS = # of procs and lmp_machine = e.g. lmp_mpi
