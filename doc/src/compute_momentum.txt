compute momentum command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID momentum :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
momentum = style name of this compute command :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 all momentum :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates the translational momentum
of a group of particles.

The momentum of each particles is computed as m v, where m and v are
the mass and velocity of the particle.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a global vector (the summed momentum) on
length 3. This value can be used by any command that uses a global
vector value from a compute as input. See the "Howto
output"_Howto_output.html doc page for an overview of LAMMPS output
options.

The vector value calculated by this compute is "extensive". The vector
value will be in momentum "units"_units.html.

[Restrictions:] none

[Related commands:]

[Default:] none
