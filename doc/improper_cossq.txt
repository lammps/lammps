improper_style cossq command :h3

[Syntax:]

improper_style cossq :pre

[Examples:]

improper_style cossq
improper_coeff 1 4.0 0.0 :pre

[Description:]

The {cossq} improper style uses the potential

:c,image(Eqs/improper_cossq.jpg)

where x is the improper angle, x0 is its equilibrium value, and K is a
prefactor.  

If the 4 atoms in an improper quadruplet (listed in the data file read
by the "read_data"_read_data.html command) are ordered I,J,K,L then X
is the angle between the plane of I,J,K and the plane of J,K,L.
Alternatively, you can think of atoms J,K,L as being in a plane, and
atom I above the plane, and X as a measure of how far out-of-plane I
is with respect to the other 3 atoms.

Note that defining 4 atoms to interact in this way, does not mean that
bonds necessarily exist between I-J, J-K, or K-L, as they would in a
linear dihedral.  Normally, the bonds I-J, I-K, I-L would exist for an
improper to be defined between the 4 atoms.

The following coefficients must be defined for each improper type via
the "improper_coeff"_improper_coeff.html command as in the example
above, or in the data file or restart files read by the
"read_data"_read_data.html or "read_restart"_read_restart.html
commands:

K (energy/radian^2)
X0 (degrees) :ul

X0 is specified in degrees, but LAMMPS converts it to radians
internally; hence the units of K are in energy/radian^2.

[Restrictions:]

This improper style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
USER-MISC package.  See the "Making LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3
section for more info on packages.
