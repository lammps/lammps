<P>where x is the improper angle, x0 is its equilibrium value, and K is a
prefactor.  
</P>
<P>If the 4 atoms in an improper quadruplet (listed in the data file read
by the <A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> command) are ordered I,J,K,L then X
is the angle between the plane of I,J,K and the plane of J,K,L.
Alternatively, you can think of atoms J,K,L as being in a plane, and
atom I above the plane, and X as a measure of how far out-of-plane I
is with respect to the other 3 atoms.
</P>
<P>Note that defining 4 atoms to interact in this way, does not mean that
bonds necessarily exist between I-J, J-K, or K-L, as they would in a
linear dihedral.  Normally, the bonds I-J, I-K, I-L would exist for an
improper to be defined between the 4 atoms.
</P>
<P>The following coefficients must be defined for each improper type via
the <A HREF = "improper_coeff.html">improper_coeff</A> command as in the example
above, or in the data file or restart files read by the
<A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> or <A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A>
commands:
</P>
<UL><LI>K (energy/radian^2)
<LI>X0 (degrees) 
</UL>
<P>X0 is specified in degrees, but LAMMPS converts it to radians
internally; hence the units of K are in energy/radian^2.

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This improper style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
USER-MISC package.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making LAMMPS</A>
section for more info on packages.
