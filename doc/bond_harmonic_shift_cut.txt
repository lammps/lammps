bond_style harmonic/shift/cut command :h3

[Syntax:]

bond_style harmonic/shift/cut :pre

[Examples:]

bond_style harmonic/shift/cut
bond_coeff 5 10.0 0.5 1.0 :pre

[Description:]

The {harmonic/shift/cut} bond style is a shifted harmonic bond that
uses the potential

:c,image(Eqs/bond_harmonic_shift_cut.jpg)

where r0 is the equilibrium bond distance, and rc the critical distance.
The bond potential is zero for distances r > rc. The potential is -Umin
at r0 and zero at rc. The spring constant is k = Umin / \[ 2 (r0-rc)^2\].

The following coefficients must be defined for each bond type via the
"bond_coeff"_bond_coeff.html command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the "read_data"_read_data.html
or "read_restart"_read_restart.html commands:

Umin (energy)
r0 (distance)
rc (distance) :ul

[Restrictions:]

This bond style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
"user-misc" package.  See the "Making LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#2_3
section for more info on packages.

"bond_harmonicshift"_bond_harmonicshift.html

[Default:] none
