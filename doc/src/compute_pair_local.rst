Description
"""""""""""

Define a computation that calculates properties of individual pairwise
interactions.  The number of datums generated, aggregated across all
processors, equals the number of pairwise interactions in the system.

The local data stored by this command is generated by looping over the
pairwise neighbor list.  Info about an individual pairwise interaction
will only be included if both atoms in the pair are in the specified
compute group, and if the current pairwise distance is less than the
force cutoff distance for that interaction, as defined by the
:doc:`pair_style <pair_style>` and :doc:`pair_coeff <pair_coeff>`
commands.

The value *dist* is the distance between the pair of atoms.

The value *eng* is the interaction energy for the pair of atoms.

The value *force* is the force acting between the pair of atoms, which
is positive for a repulsive force and negative for an attractive
force.  The values *fx*\ , *fy*\ , and *fz* are the xyz components of
*force* on atom I.

A pair style may define additional pairwise quantities which can be
accessed as *p1* to *pN*\ , where N is defined by the pair style.  Most
pair styles do not define any additional quantities, so N = 0.  An
example of ones that do are the :doc:`granular pair styles <pair_gran>`
which calculate the tangential force between two particles and return
its components and magnitude acting on atom I for N = 1,2,3,4.  See
individual pair styles for details.

When using *pN* with pair style *hybrid*\ , the output will be the Nth
quantity from the sub-style that computes the pairwise interaction
(based on atom types).  If that sub-style does not define a *pN*\ ,
the output will be 0.0.  The maximum allowed N is the maximum number
of quantities provided by any sub-style.

When using *pN* with pair style *hybrid/overlay* the quantities
from all sub-styles that provide them are concatenated together
into one long list. For example, if there are 3 sub-styles and
2 of them have additional output (with 3 and 4 quantities,
respectively), then 7 values (\ *p1* up to *p7*\ ) are defined.
The values *p1* to *p3* refer to quantities defined by the first
of the two sub-styles.  Values *p4* to *p7* refer to quantities
from the second of the two sub-styles.  If the referenced *pN*
is not computed for the specific pairwise interaction (based on
atom types), then the output will be 0.0.

The value *dist* will be in distance :doc:`units <units>`.  The value
*eng* will be in energy :doc:`units <units>`.  The values *force*\ , *fx*\ ,
*fy*\ , and *fz* will be in force :doc:`units <units>`.  The values *pN*
will be in whatever units the pair style defines.

The optional *cutoff* keyword determines how the force cutoff distance
for an interaction is determined.  For the default setting of *type*\ ,
the pairwise cutoff defined by the :doc:`pair_style <pair_style>`
command for the types of the two atoms is used.  For the *radius*
setting, the sum of the radii of the two particles is used as a
cutoff.  For example, this is appropriate for granular particles which
only interact when they are overlapping, as computed by :doc:`granular pair styles <pair_gran>`.  Note that if a granular model defines atom
types such that all particles of a specific type are monodisperse
(same diameter), then the two settings are effectively identical.

Note that as atoms migrate from processor to processor, there will be
no consistent ordering of the entries within the local vector or array
from one timestep to the next.  The only consistency that is
guaranteed is that the ordering on a particular timestep will be the
same for local vectors or arrays generated by other compute commands.
For example, pair output from the :doc:`compute property/local <compute_property_local>` command can be combined
with data from this command and output by the :doc:`dump local <dump>`
command in a consistent way.

Here is an example of how to do this:


.. parsed-literal::

   compute 1 all property/local patom1 patom2
   compute 2 all pair/local dist eng force
   dump 1 all local 1000 tmp.dump index c_1[1] c_1[2] c_2[1] c_2[2] c_2[3]

.. note::

   For pairs, if two atoms I,J are involved in 1-2, 1-3, 1-4
   interactions within the molecular topology, their pairwise interaction
   may be turned off, and thus they may not appear in the neighbor list,
   and will not be part of the local data created by this command.  More
   specifically, this will be true of I,J pairs with a weighting factor
   of 0.0; pairs with a non-zero weighting factor are included.  The
   weighting factors for 1-2, 1-3, and 1-4 pairwise interactions are set
   by the :doc:`special_bonds <special_bonds>` command.  An exception is if
   long-range Coulombics are being computed via the
   :doc:`kspace_style <kspace_style>` command, then atom pairs with
   weighting factors of zero are still included in the neighbor list, so
   that a portion of the long-range interaction contribution can be
   computed in the pair style.  Hence in that case, those atom pairs will
   be part of the local data created by this command.

**Output info:**

This compute calculates a local vector or local array depending on the
number of keywords.  The length of the vector or number of rows in the
array is the number of pairs.  If a single keyword is specified, a
local vector is produced.  If two or more keywords are specified, a
local array is produced where the number of columns = the number of
keywords.  The vector or array can be accessed by any command that
uses local values from a compute as input.  See the :doc:`Howto output <Howto_output>` doc page for an overview of LAMMPS output
options.

The output for *dist* will be in distance :doc:`units <units>`.  The
output for *eng* will be in energy :doc:`units <units>`.  The output for
*force*\ , *fx*\ , *fy*\ , and *fz* will be in force :doc:`units <units>`.
The output for *pN* will be in whatever units the pair style defines.
