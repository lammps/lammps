This is done by applying the equations of linear elastic fracture mechanics for the displacement of atoms in the block.  A “skin” of atoms around the border parallel to the crack front should be kept fixed whereas the atoms around the crack tip are free to deform according to the formalism molecular dynamics and the specified interatomic potential.  The package requires no external libraries, and multiple fracture modes and intensities can be combined based on the needs of the user.Multiple fixes for multiple modes can be included in the same script and can be run simultaneously. The crack front will always be along the z-axis. The package is designed to run using units “metal”.  The shear modulus should be entered in GPa, and the stress intensity in MPa√m.To introduce the crack with desired tip intensity, the displacement equations of linear elastic fracture mechanics are applied to all atoms in the defined sample, given below [1]:ux = (KI/mu)*sqrt(rdist/(2*PI))*(cos(t/2)*(1.0 - 2.0*(nu) + sin^2(t/2)) + (KII/mu)*sqrt(rdist/(2*PI))*(sin(t/2)*(2.0 - 2.0*(nu) + cos^2(t/2))ux = (KI/mu)*sqrt(rdist/(2*PI))*(sin(t/2)*(1.0 - 2.0*(nu) - cos^2(t/2)) + (KII/mu)*sqrt(rdist/(2*PI))*(cos(t/2)*(-1.0 + 2.0*(nu) + sin^2(t/2))uz = (KIII/mu)*sqrt(rdist/2*PI))*sin(t/2)Where   KI, II, III are all tip stress intensity values in modes I, II, and III respectively.  (mu) is the shear modulus, and (nu) is the Poisson ratio of the material and r and t are the angle and distance to the crack tip in the x-y plane, respectively.  The fix introduces a crack in the sample with the user-specified crack tip intensity value (K), with the mode specified.  Multiple different fixes can be defined in the same script if a user wants to introduce a crack with more than just one mode.  Once introduced, the crack can be expanded at a user-defined rate, with the K_increase parameter, per simulation time-step.It is necessary to first define a “border” or skin of atoms around the sample. To do this, utilize the “region” and “group” commands in correspondence with the sample dimensions (see example scripts). This border needs to be larger than the range of the interatomic potential used and the atomic positions within the border region are kept fixed.  As an example, if you have a 81.6 nm by 81.6 nm by 81.6 nm box structure filled with a single crystal of gold (lattice parameter 0.408 nm) with origin in the box center, the crack front (as specified by the fix) will be parallel to the z axis, and the crack propagation direction will oriented along the x axis.  The skin should be around 2.0 nm thick, parallel to the crack front.  This is specifically larger than the range of the atomic potential used.  So, this is all atoms where x < 79.6, x > -79.6, and y < 79.6, y > -79.6.  All atoms in this region will be defined as group “border.”  Everything inside of it will be defined as group “mobile.” This example of this is documented both of the example input scripts.After a border has been defined, the user needs to open the crack to a specified stress intensity, through the fix, which is applied to all atoms (fixed and free, as shown in the figure referenced below).  Ideally, this initial opening should be at a value for critical stress intensity so that the crack will neither close nor advance. Determining this critical value for K usually takes a little trial and error, since it is potential-dependent.  For typical metals, a stress intensity of around K = 1.2 MPa√m is a good place to start.  In order to study crack blunting or propagation, this first sicrack fix command must be unfixed and a second fix_applied with K_initial as zero, with K_increase used to further increase the stress intensity.  This value is the rate of increase of K per step, with step as defined by the LAMMPS timestep command.  The second fix should be applied only to the border atoms.  Then specifically define “fix NPT” only the internal  “non-boundary” free atoms.  Since  “fix sicrack” is applied only the external, border atoms, this will avoid performing two separate time integrations on a single group of atoms, which would generate a warning. The motion of the interior free atoms is governed by molecular dynamics, while atom motion in the border, far from the crack tip is given by linear elastic fracture mechanics.Something important to keep in mind when setting up a simulation is the rate at which K increases.  If the atom displacements are a significant fraction of a lattice parameter on any particular step, the sample border can dissociate entirely from the bulk sample, and the simulation will fail. If the rate of increase is kept low, however, the bulk will conform to the border. Figure 1 illustrates this for a mode 1 crack.(See /JPG/user_sicrack_figure1.png)Figure 1: Border or “fixed” atoms and nucleation of a mode I crack.  Similar setups can be used for modes II and III.This formalism has been used for to simulate fracture behavior in zirconium, [2] tantalum [3] and nickel [4] . It has also been used to model microstructural evolution in the crack tip region in single and polycrystalline systems. [5, 6][Restrictions:]-The use of this fix is limited to the nvt and nve ensembles.  - This fix is not compatible with periodic boundary conditions in either the x or y directions.   Either periodic or free surface boundary conditions along the Z axis are possible.   -If modes II or III are used without a mode I contribution, any displaced atoms on the crack front that are close enough to the other side of the crack will re-bond, eliminating the defined front.  This is specifically different from the method of introducing a crack defined on the LAMMPS website (Example crack) because “fix sicrack” does not delete any atoms or bonds.  -  If the crack advances significantly into the sample as increasing stress intensity is applied, the user will need to update the crack tip position.  The new tip position needs to be monitored from sample snapshots as the deformation proceeds.[Related Commands:]None [Default:]None[Bibliography:]          1.
