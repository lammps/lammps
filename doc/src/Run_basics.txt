Basics of running LAMMPS :hx

LAMMPS is run from the command line, reading commands from standard
input:

lmp_linux < in.file
lmp_linux -in in.file
~/lammps/src/lmp_linux < in.file
mpirun -np 4 lmp_linux -in in.lj :pre
mpirun -np 4 /usr/local/bin/lmp_linux -in in.lj :pre

Run from the directory your input script is in, is where output
is produced.  The executable can be someplace else

serial vs parallel

The redirection operator can often be used with mpirun, but
some systems require the -in form.

it will simply wait, expecting commands from the keyboard.  Typically
you should put commands in an input script and use I/O redirection,

For parallel environments this should also work.  If it does not, use
the '-in' command-line switch, e.g.

The "Commands section"_Commands.html describes how input scripts are
structured and commands they can contain.

MPI options, like bind to core
threads via env variables
see accelarator packages

You can run LAMMPS any of the sample inputs provided in the examples
or bench directory.  Input scripts are named in.* and sample outputs
are named log.*.name.P where name is a machine and P is the number of
processors it was run on.

Some require LAMMPS to be built with optional pacakges.

As LAMMPS runs it prints info to the screen and a logfile named
log.lammps.

If LAMMPS encounters errors in the input script or while running a
simulation it will print an ERROR message and stop or a WARNING
message and continue.  See "Section 12"_Section_errors.html for a
discussion of the various kinds of errors LAMMPS can or can't detect,
a list of all ERROR and WARNING messages, and what to do about them.

LAMMPS can run a problem on any number of processors, including a
single processor.  In theory you should get identical answers on any
number of processors and on any machine.  In practice, numerical
round-off can cause slight differences and eventual divergence of
molecular dynamics phase space trajectories.  See errors section.

LAMMPS can run as large a problem as will fit in the physical memory
of one or more processors.  If you run out of memory, you must run on
more processors or setup a smaller problem.
