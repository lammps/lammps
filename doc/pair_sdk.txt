pair_style lj/sdk command :h3
pair_style lj/sdk/gpu command :h3
pair_style lj/sdk/omp command :h3
pair_style lj/sdk/coul/long command :h3
pair_style lj/sdk/coul/long/gpu command :h3
pair_style lj/sdk/coul/long/omp command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style style args :pre

style = {lj/sdk} or {lj/sdk/coul/long}
args = list of arguments for a particular style :ul
  {lj/sdk} args = cutoff
    cutoff = global cutoff for Lennard Jones interactions (distance units)
  {lj/sdk/coul/long} args = cutoff (cutoff2)
    cutoff = global cutoff for LJ (and Coulombic if only 1 arg) (distance units)
    cutoff2 = global cutoff for Coulombic (optional) (distance units) :pre

[Examples:]

pair_style lj/sdk 2.5
pair_coeff 1 1 lj12_6 1 1.1 2.8 :pre

pair_style lj/sdk/coul/long 10.0
pair_style lj/sdk/coul/long 10.0 12.0
pair_coeff 1 1 lj9_6 100.0 3.5 12.0 :pre

[Description:]

The {lj/sdk} styles compute a 9/6, 12/4, or 12/6 Lennard-Jones potential,
given by

:c,image(Eqs/pair_cmm.jpg)

as required for the SDK Coarse-grained MD parametrization discussed in
"(Shinoda)"_#Shinoda and "(DeVane)"_#DeVane.  Rc is the cutoff.

Style {lj/sdk/coul/long} computes the adds Coulombic interactions 
with an additional damping factor applied so it can be used in 
conjunction with the "kspace_style"_kspace_style.html command and
its {ewald} or {pppm} or {pppm/cg} option.  The Coulombic cutoff
specified for this style means that pairwise interactions within
this distance are computed directly; interactions outside that
distance are computed in reciprocal space.

The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atoms
types via the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command as in the examples
above, or in the data file or restart files read by the
"read_data"_read_data.html or "read_restart"_read_restart.html
commands, or by mixing as described below:

cg_type (lj9_6, lj12_4, or lj12_6)
epsilon (energy units)
sigma (distance units)
cutoff1 (distance units) :ul

Note that sigma is defined in the LJ formula as the zero-crossing
distance for the potential, not as the energy minimum. The prefactors
are chosen so that the potential minimum is at -epsilon.

The latter 2 coefficients are optional.  If not specified, the global
LJ and Coulombic cutoffs specified in the pair_style command are used.
If only one cutoff is specified, it is used as the cutoff for both LJ
and Coulombic interactions for this type pair.  If both coefficients
are specified, they are used as the LJ and Coulombic cutoffs for this
type pair.

For {lj/sdk/coul/long} only the LJ cutoff can be specified since a
Coulombic cutoff cannot be specified for an individual I,J type pair.
All type pairs use the same global Coulombic cutoff specified in the
pair_style command.

Styles with a {cuda}, {gpu}, {intel}, {kk}, {omp} or {opt} suffix are
functionally the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.
They have been optimized to run faster, depending on your available
hardware, as discussed in "Section_accelerate"_Section_accelerate.html
of the manual.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and
should produce the same results, except for round-off and precision
issues.

These accelerated styles are part of the USER-CUDA, GPU, USER-INTEL,
KOKKOS, USER-OMP, and OPT packages respectively.  They are only
enabled if LAMMPS was built with those packages.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info.

You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the "-suffix command-line
switch"_Section_start.html#start_7 when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can
use the "suffix"_suffix.html command in your input script.

See "Section_accelerate"_Section_accelerate.html of the manual for
more instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.

[Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, and rRESPA info]:

For atom type pairs I,J and I != J, the epsilon and sigma coefficients
and cutoff distance for all of the lj/sdk pair styles {cannot} be mixed,
since different pairs may have different exponents. So all parameters
for all pairs have to be specified explicitly through the "pair_coeff"
command. Defining then in a data file is also not supported, due to
limitations of that file format.

All of the lj/sdk pair styles support the
"pair_modify"_pair_modify.html shift option for the energy of the
Lennard-Jones portion of the pair interaction.

The {lj/sdk/coul/long} pair styles support the
"pair_modify"_pair_modify.html table option since they can tabulate
the short-range portion of the long-range Coulombic interaction.

All of the lj/sdk pair styles write their information to "binary
restart files"_restart.html, so pair_style and pair_coeff commands do
not need to be specified in an input script that reads a restart file.

The lj/sdk and lj/cut/coul/long pair styles do not support 
the use of the {inner}, {middle}, and {outer} keywords of the "run_style
respa"_run_style.html command.

:line

[Restrictions:]

All of the lj/sdk pair styles are part of the USER-CG-CMM package.
The {lj/sdk/coul/long} style also requires the KSPACE package to be
built (which is enabled by default).  They are only enabled if LAMMPS
was built with that package.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info.

[Default:] none
