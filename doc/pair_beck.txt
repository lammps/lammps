pair_style beck command :h3
pair_style beck/gpu command :h3
pair_style beck/omp command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style beck Rc :pre

Rc = cutoff for interactions (distance units) :ul

[Examples:] 

pair_style beck 8.0
pair_coeff * * 399.671876712 0.0000867636112694 0.675 4.390 0.0003746
pair_coeff 1 1 399.671876712 0.0000867636112694 0.675 4.390 0.0003746 6.0 :pre

[Description:]

Style {beck} computes interactions based on the potential by
"(Beck)"_#Beck, originally designed for simulation of Helium.  It
includes truncation at a cutoff distance Rc.

:c,image(Eqs/pair_beck.jpg)

The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atoms
types via the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command as in the examples
above, or in the data file or restart files read by the
"read_data"_read_data.html or "read_restart"_read_restart.html
commands.

A (energy units)
B (energy-distance^6 units)
a (distance units)
alpha (1/distance units)
beta  (1/distance^6 units)
cutoff (distance units) :ul

The last coefficient is optional.  If not specified, the global cutoff
Rc is used.

Styles with a {cuda}, {gpu}, {intel}, {kk}, {omp}, or {opt} suffix are
functionally the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.
They have been optimized to run faster, depending on your available
hardware, as discussed in "Section_accelerate"_Section_accelerate.html
of the manual.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and
should produce the same results, except for round-off and precision
issues.

These accelerated styles are part of the USER-CUDA, GPU, USER-INTEL,
KOKKOS, USER-OMP and OPT packages, respectively.  They are only
enabled if LAMMPS was built with those packages.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info.

You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the "-suffix command-line
switch"_Section_start.html#start_7 when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can
use the "suffix"_suffix.html command in your input script.

See "Section_accelerate"_Section_accelerate.html of the manual for
more instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.

[Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info]:

For atom type pairs I,J and I != J, coeffiecients must be specified.
No default miture rules are used.

This pair style does not support the "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html shift
option for the energy of the pair interaction.

The "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html table option is not relevant
for this pair style.

This pair style does not support the "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html
tail option for adding long-range tail corrections.

This pair style writes its information to "binary restart
files"_restart.html, so pair_style and pair_coeff commands do not need
to be specified in an input script that reads a restart file.

This pair style can only be used via the {pair} keyword of the
"run_style respa"_run_style.html command.  It does not support the
{inner}, {middle}, {outer} keywords.
