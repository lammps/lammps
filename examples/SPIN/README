This directory contains examples and applications of the SPIN package
=====================================================================

- the iron, cobalt_hcp, cobalt_fcc and nickel directories provide 
  examples of spin-lattice calculations.

- the bfo repository provides an example of spin dynamics 
  calculation performed on a fixed lattice, and applied to the 
  multiferroic material bismuth-oxide. 

- the read_restart directory provides examples allowing to write 
  or read data files, and restart magneto-mechanical simulations.  

- the setforce_spin repository contains examples showing how the
  magnetic force can be imposed of a cell domain.

- the spinmin repository contains examples using the different
  spin minimizers implemented (damped dynamics, cg and lbfgs).

- the gneb repository contains two examples using the geodesic
  nudged elestic band methodology, that calculates the energy
  barrier separating two energy minima.

- the dipole_spin repository contains examples using the Ewald
  and P3M methodologies to compute the long-range dipolar
  fields.

- vizualization of the dump files can be achieved using Ovito or 
  VMD. See the vmd repository for help vizualizing results with VMD. 

** Note, the aim of this repository is mainly to provide users with
examples. Better values and tuning of the magnetic and mechanical 
interactions can be achieved for more accurate materials 
simulations. **
