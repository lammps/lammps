This package implements a "fix atc" command which can be used in a
LAMMPS input script.  This fix can be employed to either do concurrent
coupling of MD with FE-based physics surrogates or on-the-fly
post-processing of atomic information to continuum fields.  See the
doc page for the fix atc command to get started.
