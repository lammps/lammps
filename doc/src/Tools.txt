Auxiliary tools :h2

LAMMPS is designed to be a computational kernel for performing
molecular dynamics computations.  Additional pre- and post-processing
steps are often necessary to setup and analyze a simulation.  A list
of such tools can be found on the "LAMMPS webpage"_lws at these links:

"Pre/Post processing"_http://lammps.sandia.gov/prepost.html
"Offsite LAMMPS packages & tools"_http://lammps.sandia.gov/offsite.html
"Pizza.py toolkit"_pizza :ul

The last link for "Pizza.py"_pizza is a Python-based tool developed at
Sandia which provides tools for doing setup, analysis, plotting, and
visualization for LAMMPS simulations.

:link(pizza,http://pizza.sandia.gov)
:link(python,http://www.python.org)

Additional tools included in the LAMMPS distribution are described on
this page.

Note that many users write their own setup or analysis tools or use
other existing codes and convert their output to a LAMMPS input format
or vice versa.  The tools listed here are included in the LAMMPS
distribution as examples of auxiliary tools.  Some of them are not
actively supported by the LAMMPS developers, as they were contributed
by LAMMPS users.  If you have problems using them, we can direct you
to the authors.

The source code for each of these codes is in the tools sub-directory
of the LAMMPS distribution.  There is a Makefile (which you may need
to edit for your platform) which will build several of the tools which
reside in that directory.  Most of them are larger packages in their
own sub-directories with their own Makefiles and/or README files.

Tool descriptions :h3

amber2lmp tool :h4,link(amber)

The amber2lmp sub-directory contains two Python scripts for converting
files back-and-forth between the AMBER MD code and LAMMPS.  See the
README file in amber2lmp for more information.

These tools were written by Keir Novik while he was at Queen Mary
University of London.  Keir is no longer there and cannot support
these tools which are out-of-date with respect to the current LAMMPS
version (and maybe with respect to AMBER as well).  Since we don't use
these tools at Sandia, you'll need to experiment with them and make
necessary modifications yourself.

:line

binary2txt tool :h4,link(binary)

The file binary2txt.cpp converts one or more binary LAMMPS dump file
into ASCII text files.  The syntax for running the tool is

binary2txt file1 file2 ... :pre

which creates file1.txt, file2.txt, etc.  This tool must be compiled
on a platform that can read the binary file created by a LAMMPS run,
since binary files are not compatible across all platforms.

:line

ch2lmp tool :h4,link(charmm)

The ch2lmp sub-directory contains tools for converting files
back-and-forth between the CHARMM MD code and LAMMPS.

They are intended to make it easy to use CHARMM as a builder and as a
post-processor for LAMMPS. Using charmm2lammps.pl, you can convert a
PDB file with associated CHARMM info, including CHARMM force field
data, into its LAMMPS equivalent. Support for the CMAP correction of
CHARMM22 and later is available as an option. This tool can also add
solvent water molecules and Na+ or Cl- ions to the system.
Using lammps2pdb.pl you can convert LAMMPS atom dumps into PDB files.

See the README file in the ch2lmp sub-directory for more information.

These tools were created by Pieter in't Veld (pjintve at sandia.gov)
and Paul Crozier (pscrozi at sandia.gov) at Sandia.

CMAP support added and tested by Xiaohu Hu (hux2 at ornl.gov) and
Robert A. Latour (latourr at clemson.edu), David Hyde-Volpe, and
Tigran Abramyan, (Clemson University) and
Chris Lorenz (chris.lorenz at kcl.ac.uk), King's College London.

:line

chain tool :h4,link(chain)

The file chain.f creates a LAMMPS data file containing bead-spring
polymer chains and/or monomer solvent atoms.  It uses a text file
containing chain definition parameters as an input.  The created
chains and solvent atoms can strongly overlap, so LAMMPS needs to run
the system initially with a "soft" pair potential to un-overlap it.
The syntax for running the tool is

chain < def.chain > data.file :pre

See the def.chain or def.chain.ab files in the tools directory for
examples of definition files.  This tool was used to create the system
for the "chain benchmark"_Speed_bench.html.

:line

colvars tools :h4,link(colvars)

The colvars directory contains a collection of tools for post-processing
data produced by the colvars collective variable library.
To compile the tools, edit the makefile for your system and run "make".

Please report problems and issues the colvars library and its tools
at: https://github.com/colvars/colvars/issues

abf_integrate:

MC-based integration of multidimensional free energy gradient
Version 20110511

Syntax: ./abf_integrate < filename > \[-n < nsteps >\] \[-t < temp >\] \[-m \[0|1\] (metadynamics)\] \[-h < hill_height >\] \[-f < variable_hill_factor >\] :pre

The LAMMPS interface to the colvars collective variable library, as
well as these tools, were created by Axel Kohlmeyer (akohlmey at
gmail.com) at ICTP, Italy.

post-processing LAMMPS output.  The scripts include readers for log
and dump files, a reader for EAM potential files, and a converter that
reads LAMMPS dump files and produces CFG files that can be visualized
with the "AtomEye"_http://mt.seas.upenn.edu/Archive/Graphics/A
visualizer.

micelle2d tool :h4,link(micelle)

The file micelle2d.f creates a LAMMPS data file containing short lipid
chains in a monomer solution.  It uses a text file containing lipid
definition parameters as an input.  The created molecules and solvent
atoms can strongly overlap, so LAMMPS needs to run the system
initially with a "soft" pair potential to un-overlap it.  The syntax
for running the tool is

micelle2d < def.micelle2d > data.file :pre

See the def.micelle2d file in the tools directory for an example of a
definition file.  This tool was used to create the system for the
"micelle example"_Examples.html.

to remove bugs and adapt its output to changes in LAMMPS.

This tool has several known limitations and is no longer under active
development, so there are no changes except for the occasional bug fix.
