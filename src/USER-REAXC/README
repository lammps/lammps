This package contains a implementation for LAMMPS of the ReaxFF force
field.  ReaxFF uses distance-dependent bond-order functions to
represent the contributions of chemical bonding to the potential
energy.  It was originally developed by Adri van Duin and the Goddard
group at CalTech.

The USER-REAXC version of ReaxFF (pair_style reax/c), implemented in
C, should give identical or very similar results to pair_style reax,
which is a ReaxFF implementation on top of a Fortran library, a
version of which library was originally authored by Adri van Duin.

The reax/c version should be somewhat faster and more scalable,
particularly with respect to the charge equilibration calculation.  It
should also be easier to build and use since there are no complicating
issues with Fortran memory allocation or linking to a Fortran library.

For technical details about this implemention of ReaxFF, see
this paper:

Parallel and Scalable Reactive Molecular Dynamics: Numerical Methods
and Algorithmic Techniques, H. M. Aktulga, J. C. Fogarty,
S. A. Pandit, A. Y. Grama, Parallel Computing, in press (2011).

See the doc page for the pair_style reax/c command for details
of how to use it in LAMMPS.

The person who created this package is Hasan Metin Aktulga (hmaktulga

Aidan Thompson at Sandia (athomps at sandia.gov), if you have
questions.

Thanks to Steve Plimpton and Aidan Thompson for their input on the
LAMMPS architecture and for their help in understanding and
customizing some of the required LAMMPS interfaces.
