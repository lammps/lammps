</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>The <I>hybrid</I> style enables the use of multiple dihedral styles in one
simulation.  An dihedral style is assigned to each dihedral type.  For
example, dihedrals in a polymer flow (of dihedral type 1) could be
computed with a <I>harmonic</I> potential and dihedrals in the wall
boundary (of dihedral type 2) could be computed with a <I>helix</I>
potential.  The assignment of dihedral type to style is made via the
<A HREF = "dihedral_coeff.html">dihedral_coeff</A> command or in the data file.
</P>
<P>In the dihedral_coeff command, the first coefficient sets the dihedral
style and the remaining coefficients are those appropriate to that
style.  In the example above, the 2 dihedral_coeff commands would set
dihedrals of dihedral type 1 to be computed with a <I>harmonic</I>
potential with coefficients 80.0, 1.2 for K, d, n.  Dihedral type 2
would be computed with a <I>helix</I> potential with coefficients 10.0,
10.0, 10.0 for A, B, C.
</P>
<P>If the dihedral <I>class2</I> potential is one of the hybrid styles, it
requires additional MiddleBondTorsion, EndBondTorsion, AngleTorsion,
AngleAngleTorsion, and BondBond13 coefficients be specified in the
data file.  These lines must also have an additional "class2" argument
added after the dihedral type.  For dihedral types which are assigned
to other hybrid styles, use the style name (e.g. "harmonic")
appropriate to that style.  The MiddleBondTorsion, etc coeffs for that
dihedral type will then be ignored.
</P>
<P>A dihedral style of <I>none</I> can be specified as an argument to
dihedral_style hybrid and the corresponding dihedral_coeff commands,
if you desire to turn off certain dihedral types.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This dihedral style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
"molecular" package (which it is by default).  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#2_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info on packages.
</P>
<P>Unlike other dihedral styles, the hybrid dihedral style does not store
dihedral coefficient info for individual sub-styles in a <A HREF = "restart.html">binary
restart files</A>.  Thus when retarting a simulation from a
restart file, you need to re-specify dihedral_coeff commands.
