[Description:]

Calculate one or more instantaneous per-atom quantities every few
timesteps, average them by layer in a chosen dimension, and average
the layer values over a longer timescale.  The resulting averages can
be used by other "output commands"_Section_howto.html#4_15 such as
"thermo_style custom"_thermo_style.html, and can also be written to a
file.

Each listed value is averaged independently.  The group specified with
the command means only atoms within the group contribute to the layer
averages.

Each listed value can be an atom attribute (position, velocity, force
component), a mass or number density, or the result of a
"compute"_compute.html or "fix"_fix.html or the evaluation of an
atom-style "variable"_variable.html.  In the latter cases, the
compute, fix, or variable must produce a per-atom quantity, not a
global quantity.  If you wish to time-average global quantities from a
compute, fix, or variable, then see the "fix
ave/time"_fix_ave_time.html command.

"Computes"_compute.html that produce per-atom quantities are those
which have the word {atom} in their style name.  See the doc pages for
individual "fixes"_fix.html to determine which ones produce per-atom
quantities.  "Variables"_variable.html of style {atom} are the only
ones that can be used with this fix since all other styles of variable
produce global quantities.

:line

The {Nevery}, {Nrepeat}, and {Nfreq} arguments specify on what
timesteps the layer values will be generated in order to contribute to
the average.  The final averaged quantities are generated every
{Nfreq} timesteps.  The average is over {Nrepeat} quantities, computed
in the preceding portion of the simulation every {Nevery} timesteps.
{Nfreq} must be a multiple of {Nevery} and {Nevery} must be non-zero
even if {Nrepeat} is 1.

For example, if Nevery=2, Nrepeat=6, and Nfreq=100, then values on
timesteps 90,92,94,96,98,100 will be used to compute the final average
on timestep 100.  Similarly for timesteps 190,192,194,196,198,200 on
timestep 200, etc.  If Nrepeat=1 and Nfreq = 100, then no time
averaging is done; values are simply generated on timesteps
100,200,etc.

:line

Each per-atom property is also averaged over atoms in each layer,
where the layers are in a particular {dim} and have a thickness given
by {delta}.  Every Nfreq steps, when an averaging is being performed
and the per-atom property is calculated for the first time, the number
of layers and the layer boundaries are computed.  Thus if the
simulation box changes size during a simulation, the number of layers
and their boundaries may also change.  Layers are defined relative to
a specified {origin}, which may be the lower/upper edge of the box (in
{dim}) or its center point, or a specified coordinate value.  Starting
at the origin, sufficient layers are created in both directions to
completely cover the box.  On subsequent timesteps every atom is
mapped to one of the layers.  Atoms beyond the lowermost/uppermost
layer are counted in the first/last layer.

For orthogonal simulation boxes, the layers are "slices" aligned with
the xyz coordinate axes.  For non-orthogonal (triclinic) simulation
boxes, the layers are "tilted slices" that are parallel to the tilted
faces of the box.  See the "region prism"_region.html command for a
discussion of the geometry of tilted boxes in LAMMPS.  As described
there, a tilted simulation box has edge vectors a,b,c.  In that
nomenclature, layers in the x dimension have faces with normals in the
"b" cross "c" direction.  Layers in y have faces normal to the "a"
cross "c" direction.  And layers in z have faces normal to the "a"
cross "b" direction.  Note that in order to define the thickness and
position of these tilted layers in an unambiguous fashion, the {units}
option must be set to {reduced} when using a non-orthogonal simulation
box, as discussed below.

:line

The atom attribute values (x,y,z,vx,vy,vz,fx,fy,fz) are
self-explanatory.

The {density/number} value means the number density is computed in
each layer, i.e. a weighting of 1 for each atom.  The {density/mass}
value means the mass density is computed in each layer, i.e. each atom
is weighted by its mass.  The resulting density is normalized by the
volume of the layer so that units of number/volume or mass/volume are
output.

If a value begins with "c_", a compute ID must follow which has been
previously defined in the input script.  If no bracketed term is
appended, the per-atom scalar calculated by the compute is used.  If a
bracketed term is appended, the Nth vector per-atom value calculated
by the compute is used.  Users can also write code for their own
compute styles and "add them to LAMMPS"_Section_modify.html.

If a value begins with "f_", a fix ID must follow which has been
previously defined in the input script.  If no bracketed term is
appended, the per-atom scalar calculated by the fix is used.  If a
bracketed term is appended, the Nth vector per-atom value calculated
by the fix is used.  Note that some fixes only produce their values on
certain timesteps, which must be compatible with {Nevery}, else an
error results.  Users can also write code for their own fix styles and
"add them to LAMMPS"_Section_modify.html.

If a value begins with "v_", a variable name must follow which has
been previously defined in the input script.  Variables of style
{atom} can reference thermodynamic keywords, or invoke other computes,
fixes, or variables when they are evaluated, so this is a very general
means of generating per-atom quantities to spatially average.

:line

Additional optional keywords also affect the operation of this fix.

The {units} keyword determines the meaning of the distance units used
for the layer thickness {delta} and for {origin} if it is a coordinate
value.  For orthogonal simulation boxes, any of the 3 options may be
used.  For non-orthogonal (triclinic) simulation boxes, only the
{reduced} option may be used.

A {box} value selects standard distance units as defined by the
"units"_units.html command, e.g. Angstroms for units = real or metal.
A {lattice} value means the distance units are in lattice spacings.
The "lattice"_lattice.html command must have been previously used to
define the lattice spacing.  A {reduced} value means normalized
unitless values between 0 and 1, which represent the lower and upper
faces of the simulation box respectively.  Thus an {origin} value of
0.5 means the center of the box in any dimension.  A {delta} value of
0.1 means 10 layers span the box in any dimension. 

Consider a non-orthogonal box, with layers in the x dimension.  No
matter how the box is tilted, an {origin} of 0.0 means start layers at
the lower "b" cross "c" plane of the simulation box and an {origin} of
1.0 means to start layers at the upper "b" cross "c" face of the box.
A {delta} value of 0.1 means there will be 10 layers from 0.0 to 1.0,
regardless of the current size or shape of the simulation box.

The {norm} keyword affects how averaging is done for the output
produced every {Nfreq} timesteps.  For an {all} setting, a layer
quantity is summed over all atoms in all {Nrepeat} samples, as is the
count of atoms in the layer.  The printed value for the layer is
Total-quantity / Total-count.  In other words it is an average over
the entire {Nfreq} timescale.

For a {sample} setting, the layer quantity is summed over atoms for
only a single sample, as is the count, and a "average sample value" is
computed, i.e. Sample-quantity / Sample-count.  The printed value for
the layer is the average of the {Nrepeat} "average sample values", In
other words it is an average of an average.

The {file} keyword allows a filename to be specified.  Every {Nfreq}
timesteps, layer info will be written to a text file in the following
format.  A line with the timestep and number of layers is written.
Then one line per layer is written, containing the layer ID (1-N), the
coordinate of the center of the layer, the number of atoms in the
layer, and one or more calculated values.  The number of values in
each line corresponds to the number of values specified in the fix
ave/spatial command.  The number of atoms and the value(s) are average
quantities.  If the value of the {units} keyword is {box} or
{lattice}, the "coord" is printed in box units.  If the value of the
{units} keyword is {reduced}, the "coord" is printed in reduced units
(0-1).

The {ave} keyword determines how the layer values produced every
{Nfreq} steps are averaged with layer values produced on previous
steps that were multiples of {Nfreq}, before they are accessed by
another output command or written to a file.

If the {ave} setting is {one}, then the layer values produced on
timesteps that are multiples of {Nfreq} are independent of each other;
they are output as-is without further averaging.

If the {ave} setting is {running}, then the layer values produced on
timesteps that are multiples of {Nfreq} are summed and averaged in a
cumulative sense before being output.  Each output layer value is
thus the average of the layer value produced on that timestep with all
preceding values for the same layer.  This running average begins
when the fix is defined; it can only be restarted by deleting the fix
via the "unfix"_unfix.html command, or re-defining the fix by
re-specifying it.

If the {ave} setting is {window}, then the layer values produced on
timesteps that are multiples of {Nfreq} are summed and averaged within
a moving "window" of time, so that the last M values for the same
layer are used to produce the output.  E.g. if M = 3 and Nfreq = 1000,
then the output on step 10000 will be the average of the individual
layer values on steps 8000,9000,10000.  Outputs on early steps will
average over less than M values if they are not available.

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.  None of the "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html options
are relevant to this fix.

This fix computes a global vector of quantities which can be accessed
by various "output commands"_Section_howto.html#4_15.  The values can
only be accessed on timesteps that are multiples of {Nfreq} since that
is when averaging is performed.  The global vector is of length N =
nlayers*nvalues where nlayers is the number of layers and nvalues is
the number of values per layer that the fix is averaging.  When
accessed by another output command, a single index M is specified
which is mapped into a layer I as I = M / nvalues + 1 and into value J
as J = M % nvalues + 1.  If I exceeds the current number of layers
than a 0.0 is returned by the fix instead of an error, since the
number of layers can vary as a simulation runs, depending on the
simulation box size.  The vector values calculated by this fix are
"intensive", meaning they are independent of the number of atoms in
the simulation, since they are already normalized by the count of
atoms in each layer.

No parameter of this fix can be used with the {start/stop} keywords of
the "run"_run.html command.  This fix is not invoked during "energy
minimization"_minimize.html.

[Restrictions:]

When the {ave} keyword is set to {running} or {window} then the number
of layers must remain the same during the simulation, so that the
appropriate averaging can be done.  This will be the case if the
simulation box size doesn't change or if the {units} keyword is set to
{reduced}.
