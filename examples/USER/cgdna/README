This directory contains example data and input files 
and utility scripts for the oxDNA coarse-grained model 
for DNA.

/examples/duplex1:
Input, data and log files for a DNA duplex (double-stranded DNA) 
consisiting of 5 base pairs. The duplex contains two strands with 
complementary base pairs. The topology is

A - C - G - T - A
|   |   |   |   |
T - G - C - A - T     

/examples/duplex2:
Input, data and log files for a nicked DNA duplex (double-stranded DNA) 
consisiting of 8 base pairs. The duplex contains strands with 
complementary base pairs, but the backbone on one side is not continuous: 
two individual strands on one side form a duplex with a longer single 
strand on the other side. The topology is

A - C - G - T - A - C - G - T
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
T - G - C - A   T - G - C - A

/examples/duplex3:
This is basically the duplex1 run with both nucleotide mass and moment
of inertia set to the values of the standalone implementation of oxDNA, 
which are M=I=1. To achieve this, the masses were set directly, whereas
the diameter of the ellipsoid in the data file was changed to 3.16227766.
This allows direct comparision of e.g. trajectory data or energies on a
per-timestep basis until numerical noise leads eventually to deviations. 

/util:
This directory contains a simple python setup tool which creates 
single straight or helical DNA strands, DNA duplexes or arrays of DNA 
duplexes.
