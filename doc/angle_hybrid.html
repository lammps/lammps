<UL><LI>style1,style2 = list of one or more angle styles

<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>The <I>hybrid</I> style enables the use of multiple angle styles in one
simulation.  An angle style is assigned to each angle type.  For
example, angles in a polymer flow (of angle type 1) could be computed
with a <I>harmonic</I> potential and angles in the wall boundary (of angle
type 2) could be computed with a <I>cosine</I> potential.  The assignment
of angle type to style is made via the <A HREF = "angle_coeff.html">angle_coeff</A>
command or in the data file.
</P>
<P>In the angle_coeff command, the first coefficient sets the angle style
and the remaining coefficients are those appropriate to that style.
In the example above, the 2 angle_coeff commands set angles of angle
type 1 to be computed with a <I>harmonic</I> potential with coefficients
80.0, 1.2 for K, r0.  All other angle types (2-N) would be computed
with a <I>cosine</I> potential with coefficient 50.0 for K.
</P>
<P>If angle coefficients are specified in the data file read via the
<A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> command, then the same string,
e.g. "harmonic" or "cosine", must be listed as the 1st argument of
each line in the "Angle Coeffs" section, e.g.
</P>
<PRE>1 harmonic 80.0 1.2 
</PRE>
<P>If the angle <I>class2</I> potential is one of the hybrid styles, the same
rules hold for specifying the additional BondBond and BondAngle
coefficients either via the input script or in the data file.
I.e. "class2" must be added in both cases before the "bb" or "ba"
argument.
</P>
<P>An angle style of <I>none</I> can be specified as the 2nd argument to the
angle_coeff command or the 1st argument in the data file, if you desire
to turn off certain angle types.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This angle style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
"molecular" package (which it is by default).  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#2_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info on packages.
</P>
<P>Unlike other angle styles, the hybrid angle style does not store angle
coefficient info for individual sub-styles in a <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.  Thus when retarting a simulation from a restart
file, you need to re-specify angle_coeff commands.
