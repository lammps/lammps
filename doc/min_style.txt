min_style command :h3

[Syntax:]

min_style style :pre

style = {cg} or {sd} :ul

[Examples:]

min_style cg
min_style sd :pre

[Description:]

Choose a minimization algorithm to use when a "minimize"_minimize.html
command is performed.

Style {cg} is the Polak-Ribiere version of the conjugate gradient (CG)
algorithm.  At each iteration the force gradient is combined with the
previous iteration information to compute a new search direction
perpendicular (conjugate) to the previous search direction.  The PR
variant affects how the direction is chosen and how the CG method is
restarted when it ceases to make progress.  The PR variant is thought
to be the most effective CG choice.

Style {sd} is a steepest descent algorithm.  At each iteration, the
search direction is set to the downhill direction corresponding to the
force vector (negative gradient of energy).  Typically, steepest
descent will not converge as quickly as CG, but may be more robust in
some situations.
