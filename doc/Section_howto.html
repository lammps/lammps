</P>
<HR>

<A NAME = "4_1"></A><H4>4.1 Restarting a simulation 
</H4>
<P>There are 3 ways to continue a long LAMMPS simulation.  Multiple
<A HREF = "run.html">run</A> commands can be used in the same input script.  Each
run will continue from where the previous run left off.  Or binary
restart files can be saved to disk using the <A HREF = "restart.html">restart</A>
command.  At a later time, these binary files can be read via a
<A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A> command in a new script.  Or they can
be converted to text data files and read by a
<A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> command in a new script.  <A HREF = "Section_tools.html">This
section</A> discusses the <I>restart2data</I> tool that is
used to perform the conversion.
</P>
<P>Here we give examples of 2 scripts that read either a binary restart
file or a converted data file and then issue a new run command to
continue where the previous run left off.  They illustrate what
settings must be made in the new script.  Details are discussed in the
documentation for the <A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A> and
<A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> commands.
</P>
<P>Look at the <I>in.chain</I> input script provided in the <I>bench</I> directory
of the LAMMPS distribution to see the original script that these 2
scripts are based on.  If that script had the line
</P>
<PRE>restart	        50 tmp.restart 
</PRE>
<P>added to it, it would produce 2 binary restart files (tmp.restart.50
and tmp.restart.100) as it ran.
</P>
<P>This script could be used to read the 1st restart file and re-run the
last 50 timesteps:
</P>
<PRE>read_restart	tmp.restart.50 
</PRE>
<PRE>neighbor	0.4 bin
neigh_modify	every 1 delay 1 
</PRE>
<PRE>fix		1 all nve
fix		2 all langevin 1.0 1.0 10.0 904297 
</PRE>
<PRE>timestep	0.012 
</PRE>
<PRE>run		50 
</PRE>
<P>Note that the following commands do not need to be repeated because
their settings are included in the restart file: <I>units, atom_style,
special_bonds, pair_style, bond_style</I>.  However these commands do
need to be used, since their settings are not in the restart file:
<I>neighbor, fix, timestep</I>.
</P>
<P>If you actually use this script to perform a restarted run, you will
notice that the thermodynamic data match at step 50 (if you also put a
"thermo 50" command in the original script), but do not match at step
100.  This is because the <A HREF = "fix_langevin.html">fix langevin</A> command
uses random numbers in a way that does not allow for perfect restarts.
</P>
<P>As an alternate approach, the restart file could be converted to a data
file using this tool:
</P>
<PRE>restart2data tmp.restart.50 tmp.restart.data 
</PRE>
<P>Then, this script could be used to re-run the last 50 steps:
</P>
<PRE>units		lj
atom_style	bond
pair_style	lj/cut 1.12
pair_modify	shift yes
bond_style	fene
special_bonds   0.0 1.0 1.0 
</PRE>
<PRE>read_data	tmp.restart.data 
</PRE>
<PRE>neighbor	0.4 bin
neigh_modify	every 1 delay 1 
</PRE>
<PRE>fix		1 all nve
fix		2 all langevin 1.0 1.0 10.0 904297 
</PRE>
<PRE>timestep	0.012 
</PRE>
<PRE>reset_timestep	50
run		50 
</PRE>
<P>Note that nearly all the settings specified in the original <I>in.chain</I>
script must be repeated, except the <I>pair_coeff</I> and <I>bond_coeff</I>
commands since the new data file lists the force field coefficients.
Also, the <A HREF = "reset_timestep.html">reset_timestep</A> command is used to tell
LAMMPS the current timestep.  This value is stored in restart files,
but not in data files.
</P>
<HR>

<A NAME = "4_2"></A><H4>4.2 2d simulations 
</H4>
<P>Use the <A HREF = "dimension.html">dimension</A> command to specify a 2d simulation.
</P>
<P>Make the simulation box periodic in z via the <A HREF = "boundary.html">boundary</A>
command.  This is the default.
</P>
<P>If using the <A HREF = "create_box.html">create box</A> command to define a
simulation box, set the z dimensions narrow, but finite, so that the
create_atoms command will tile the 3d simulation box with a single z
plane of atoms - e.g.
</P>
<PRE><A HREF = "create_box.html">create box</A> 1 -10 10 -10 10 -0.25 0.25 
</PRE>
<P>If using the <A HREF = "read_data.html">read data</A> command to read in a file of
atom coordinates, set the "zlo zhi" values to be finite but narrow,
similar to the create_box command settings just described.  For each
atom in the file, assign a z coordinate so it falls inside the
z-boundaries of the box - e.g. 0.0.
</P>
<P>Use the <A HREF = "fix_enforce2d.html">fix enforce2d</A> command as the last
defined fix to insure that the z-components of velocities and forces
are zeroed out every timestep.  The reason to make it the last fix is
so that any forces induced by other fixes will be zeroed out.
</P>
<P>Many of the example input scripts included in the LAMMPS distribution
are for 2d models.
</P>
<HR>

<A NAME = "4_3"></A><H4>4.3 CHARMM and AMBER force fields 
</H4>
<P>There are many different ways to compute forces in the <A HREF = "http://www.scripps.edu/brooks">CHARMM</A>
and <A HREF = "http://amber.scripps.edu">AMBER</A> molecular dynamics codes, only some of which are
available as options in LAMMPS.  A force field has 2 parts: the
formulas that define it and the coefficients used for a particular
system.  Here we only discuss formulas implemented in LAMMPS.  Setting
coefficients is done in the input data file via the
<A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> command or in the input script with
commands like <A HREF = "pair_coeff.html">pair_coeff</A> or
<A HREF = "bond_coeff.html">bond_coeff</A>.  See <A HREF = "Section_tools.html">this section</A> for
additional tools that can use CHARMM or AMBER to assign force field
coefficients and convert their output into LAMMPS input.
</P>
<P>See <A HREF = "#MacKerell">(MacKerell)</A> for a description of the CHARMM force
field.  See <A HREF = "#Cornell">(Cornell)</A> for a description of the AMBER force
field.
</P>




<P>These style choices compute force field formulas that are consistent
with common options in CHARMM or AMBER.  See each command's
documentation for the formula it computes.

<A NAME = "4_4"></A><H4>4.4 Running multiple simulations from one input script 
</H4>
<P>This can be done in several ways.  See the documentation for
individual commands for more details on how these examples work.
</P>
<P>If "multiple simulations" means continue a previous simulation for
more timesteps, then you simply use the <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command
multiple times.  For example, this script
</P>
<PRE>units lj
atom_style atomic
read_data data.lj
run 10000
run 10000
run 10000
run 10000
run 10000 
</PRE>
<P>would run 5 successive simulations of the same system for a total of
50,000 timesteps.
</P>
<P>If you wish to run totally different simulations, one after the other,
the <A HREF = "clear.html">clear</A> command can be used in between them to
re-initialize LAMMPS.  For example, this script
</P>
<PRE>units lj
atom_style atomic
read_data data.lj
run 10000
clear
units lj
atom_style atomic
read_data data.lj.new
run 10000 
</PRE>
<P>would run 2 independent simulations, one after the other.
</P>
<P>For large numbers of independent simulations, you can use
<A HREF = "variable.html">variables</A> and the <A HREF = "next.html">next</A> and
<A HREF = "jump.html">jump</A> commands to loop over the same input script
multiple times with different settings.  For example, this
script, named in.polymer
</P>
<PRE>variable d index run1 run2 run3 run4 run5 run6 run7 run8
cd $d
read_data data.polymer
run 10000
cd ..
clear
next d
jump in.polymer 
</PRE>
<P>would run 8 simulations in different directories, using a data.polymer
file in each directory.  The same concept could be used to run the
same system at 8 different temperatures, using a temperature variable
and storing the output in different log and dump files, for example
</P>
<PRE>variable a loop 8
variable t index 0.8 0.85 0.9 0.95 1.0 1.05 1.1 1.15
log log.$a
read data.polymer
velocity all create $t 352839
fix 1 all nvt $t $t 100.0
dump 1 all atom 1000 dump.$a
run 100000
next t
next a
jump in.polymer 
</PRE>
<P>All of the above examples work whether you are running on 1 or
multiple processors, but assumed you are running LAMMPS on a single
partition of processors.  LAMMPS can be run on multiple partitions via
the "-partition" command-line switch as described in <A HREF = "Section_start.html#2_6">this
section</A> of the manual.
</P>
<P>In the last 2 examples, if LAMMPS were run on 3 partitions, the same
scripts could be used if the "index" and "loop" variables were
replaced with <I>universe</I>-style variables, as described in the
<A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A> command.  Also, the "next t" and "next a"
commands would need to be replaced with a single "next a t" command.
With these modifications, the 8 simulations of each script would run
on the 3 partitions one after the other until all were finished.
Initially, 3 simulations would be started simultaneously, one on each
partition.  When one finished, that partition would then start
the 4th simulation, and so forth, until all 8 were completed.

<A NAME = "4_5"></A><H4>4.5 Parallel tempering 
</H4>
<P>The <A HREF = "temper.html">temper</A> command can be used to perform a parallel
tempering or replica-exchange simulation where multiple copies of a
simulation are run at different temperatures on different sets of
processors, and Monte Carlo temperature swaps are performed between
pairs of copies.
</P>
<P>Use the -procs and -in <A HREF = "Section_start.html#2_6">command-line switches</A>

<A NAME = "4_10"></A><H4>4.10 Coupling LAMMPS to other codes 
</H4>
<P>LAMMPS is designed to allow it to be coupled to other codes.  For
example, a quantum mechanics code might compute forces on a subset of
atoms and pass those forces to LAMMPS.  Or a continuum finite element
(FE) simulation might use atom positions as boundary conditions on FE
nodal points, compute a FE solution, and return interpolated forces on
MD atoms.
</P>
<P>LAMMPS can be coupled to other codes in at least 3 ways.  Each has
advantages and disadvantages, which you'll have to think about in the
context of your application.
</P>
<P>(1) Define a new <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> command that calls the other code.  In
this scenario, LAMMPS is the driver code.  During its timestepping,
the fix is invoked, and can make library calls to the other code,
which has been linked to LAMMPS as a library.  This is the way the
<A HREF = "http://www.rpi.edu/~anderk5/lab">POEMS</A> package that performs constrained rigid-body motion on
groups of atoms is hooked to LAMMPS.  See the
<A HREF = "fix_poems.html">fix_poems</A> command for more details.  See <A HREF = "Section_modify.html">this
section</A> of the documentation for info on how to add
a new fix to LAMMPS.
</P>


<P>(2) Define a new LAMMPS command that calls the other code.  This is
conceptually similar to method (1), but in this case LAMMPS and the
other code are on a more equal footing.  Note that now the other code
is not called during the timestepping of a LAMMPS run, but between
runs.  The LAMMPS input script can be used to alternate LAMMPS runs
with calls to the other code, invoked via the new command.  The
<A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command facilitates this with its <I>every</I> option, which
makes it easy to run a few steps, invoke the command, run a few steps,
invoke the command, etc.
</P>
<P>In this scenario, the other code can be called as a library, as in
(1), or it could be a stand-alone code, invoked by a system() call
made by the command (assuming your parallel machine allows one or more
processors to start up another program).  In the latter case the
stand-alone code could communicate with LAMMPS thru files that the
command writes and reads.
</P>
<P>See <A HREF = "Section_modify.html">this section</A> of the documentation for how to
add a new command to LAMMPS.
</P>
<P>(3) Use LAMMPS as a library called by another code.  In this case the
other code is the driver and calls LAMMPS as needed.  Or a wrapper
code could link and call both LAMMPS and another code as libraries.
Again, the <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command has options that allow it to be
invoked with minimal overhead (no setup or clean-up) if you wish to do
multiple short runs, driven by another program.
</P>
<P><A HREF = "Section_start.html#2_4">This section</A> of the documentation describes
how to build LAMMPS as a library.  Once this is done, you can
interface with LAMMPS either via C++, C, or Fortran (or any other
language that supports a vanilla C-like interface, e.g. a scripting
language).  For example, from C++ you could create one (or more)
"instances" of LAMMPS, pass it an input script to process, or execute
individual commands, all by invoking the correct class methods in
LAMMPS.  From C or Fortran you can make function calls to do the same
things.  Library.cpp and library.h contain such a C interface with the
functions:
</P>
<PRE>void lammps_open(int, char **, MPI_Comm, void **);
void lammps_close(void *);
void lammps_file(void *, char *);
char *lammps_command(doivd *, char *); 
</PRE>
<P>The functions contain C++ code you could write in a C++ application
that was invoking LAMMPS directly.  Note that LAMMPS classes are
defined wihin a LAMMPS namespace (LAMMPS_NS) if you use them
from another C++ application.
</P>
<P>Two of the routines in library.cpp are of particular note.  The
lammps_open() function initiates LAMMPS and takes an MPI communicator
as an argument.  It returns a pointer to a LAMMPS "object".  As with
C++, the lammps_open() function can be called mutliple times, to
create multiple instances of LAMMPS.
</P>
<P>LAMMPS will run on the set of processors in the communicator.  This
means the calling code can run LAMMPS on all or a subset of
processors.  For example, a wrapper script might decide to alternate
between LAMMPS and another code, allowing them both to run on all the
processors.  Or it might allocate half the processors to LAMMPS and
half to the other code and run both codes simultaneously before
syncing them up periodically.
</P>
<P>Library.cpp contains a lammps_command() function to which the caller
passes a single LAMMPS command (a string).  Thus the calling code can
read or generate a series of LAMMPS commands (e.g. an input script)
one line at a time and pass it thru the library interface to setup a
problem and then run it.
</P>
<P>A few other sample functions are included in library.cpp, but the key
idea is that you can write any functions you wish to define an
interface for how your code talks to LAMMPS and add them to
library.cpp and library.h.  The routines you add can access any LAMMPS
data.  The examples/couple directory has example C++ and C codes which
show how a stand-alone code can link LAMMPS as a library, run LAMMPS
on a subset of processors, grab data from LAMMPS, change it, and put
it back into LAMMPS.
