Calculate diffusion coefficients :h3

The diffusion coefficient D of a material can be measured in at least
2 ways using various options in LAMMPS.  See the examples/DIFFUSE
directory for scripts that implement the 2 methods discussed here for
a simple Lennard-Jones fluid model.

The first method is to measure the mean-squared displacement (MSD) of
the system, via the "compute msd"_compute_msd.html command.  The slope
of the MSD versus time is proportional to the diffusion coefficient.
The instantaneous MSD values can be accumulated in a vector via the
"fix vector"_fix_vector.html command, and a line fit to the vector to
compute its slope via the "variable slope"_variable.html function, and
thus extract D.

The second method is to measure the velocity auto-correlation function
(VACF) of the system, via the "compute vacf"_compute_vacf.html
command.  The time-integral of the VACF is proportional to the
diffusion coefficient.  The instantaneous VACF values can be
accumulated in a vector via the "fix vector"_fix_vector.html command,
and time integrated via the "variable trap"_variable.html function,
and thus extract D.
