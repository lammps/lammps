fix propel/self command  :pre

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID propel/self mode magnitude

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
propel/self = style name of this fix command :l
mode = velocity or quaternion :l
magnitude = magnitude of the active force :l
:ule

[Examples:]

fix active_group all propel/self velocity 1.0
fix constant_velocity all viscous 1.0 :pre

fix active_group all propel/self quaternion 1.0 :pre

[Description:]

Adds a force of a constant magnitude to each atom in the group. The nature in
which the force is added depends on the mode.
For mode = velocity, the active force acts along the velocity vector of each
atom.
For mode = quaternion the force is along the axis obtained by rotating the
z-axis along the atom's quaternion. In other words, the force is along the
z-axis in the atom's body frame. This mode requires all atoms in the group
to have a quaternion, so atom_style should either be ellipsoid or body.

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.

This fix is not imposed  during minimization.

[Restrictions:]

This fix makes use of per-atom quaternions to take into
account the fact that the orientation can rotate and hence the direction
of the active force can change. Therefore, this fix only works with atom_styles
that have a quaternion.
