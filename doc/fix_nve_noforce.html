<UL><LI>ID, group-ID are documented in <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> command

<P><B>Examples:</B>

<PRE>fix 3 wall nve/noforce 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Perform updates of position, but not velocity for atoms in the group
each timestep.  In other words, the force on the atoms is ignored and
their velocity is not updated.  The atom's velocities are used to
update their positions.
</P>
<P>This can be useful for wall atoms, when you set their velocities, but
want the wall to move (or stay stationary) in a prescribed fashion.
</P>
<P>This can also be accomplished via the <A HREF = "fix_setforce.html">fix setforce</A>
command, but with fix nve/noforce, the forces on the wall atoms are
unchanged, and can thus be printed out by the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump</A> command
or queried with an equal-style <A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A> that uses the
fcm() group command to compute the total force on the group of atoms.
