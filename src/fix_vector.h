/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running LAMMPS to see the offending line.

E: Compute ID for fix ave/time does not exist

Self-explanatory.

E: Fix ID for fix ave/time does not exist

Self-explanatory.

E: Invalid fix ave/time off column

Self-explantory.

E: Fix ave/time compute does not calculate a scalar

Self-explantory.

E: Fix ave/time compute does not calculate a vector

Self-explantory.

E: Fix ave/time compute vector is accessed out-of-range

The index for the vector is out of bounds.

E: Fix ave/time compute does not calculate an array

Self-explanatory.

E: Fix ave/time compute array is accessed out-of-range

An index for the array is out of bounds.

E: Fix ave/time fix does not calculate a scalar

Self-explanatory.

E: Fix ave/time fix does not calculate a vector

Self-explanatory.

E: Fix ave/time fix vector is accessed out-of-range

The index for the vector is out of bounds.

E: Fix for fix ave/time not computed at compatible time

Fixes generate their values on specific timesteps.  Fix ave/time
is requesting a value on a non-allowed timestep.

E: Fix ave/time fix does not calculate an array

Self-explanatory.

E: Fix ave/time fix array is accessed out-of-range

An index for the array is out of bounds.

E: Variable name for fix ave/time does not exist

Self-explanatory.

E: Fix ave/time variable is not equal-style variable

Self-explanatory.

E: Fix ave/time cannot use variable with vector mode

Variables produce scalar values.

E: Fix ave/time columns are inconsistent lengths

Self-explanatory.

E: Fix ave/time cannot set output array intensive/extensive from these inputs

One of more of the vector inputs has individual elements which are
flagged as intensive or extensive.  Such an input cannot be flagged as
all intensive/extensive when turned into an array by fix ave/time.

E: Cannot open fix ave/time file %s

The specified file cannot be opened.  Check that the path and name are
correct.

E: Fix ave/time missed timestep

You cannot reset the timestep to a value beyond where the fix
expects to next perform averaging.
