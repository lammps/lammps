PAFI performs constrained force averages on hyperplanes to a reference pathway in order to compute unbiased free energy barriers

Unsupervised calculation of free energy barriers in large crystalline systems
Physical Review Letters 276, 1 2018


Also see https://github.com/tomswinburne/pafi/ for the PAFI code which distributes
multiple LAMMPS workers in parallel to compute and collate fix pafi averages,
allowing the calculation of free energy barriers and minimum free energy paths.

To compile:

make yes-user-misc # for PAFI
make yes-manybody # for EAM potential
make machine # for binary (machine= e.g. mpi)

To run the example from this folder:
```
mpirun -np NPROCS /path/to/lammps/src/lmp_machine -in in.pafi
```

To generate your own path, please see the LAMMPS documentation for more details
