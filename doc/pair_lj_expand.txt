pair_style lj/expand command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style lj/expand cutoff :pre

cutoff = global cutoff for lj/expand interactions (distance units) :ul

[Examples:]

pair_style lj/expand 2.5
pair_coeff * * 1.0 1.0 0.5
pair_coeff 1 1 1.0 1.0 -0.2 2.0 :pre

[Description:]

Style {lj/expand} computes a LJ interaction with a distance shifted by
delta which can be useful when particles are of different sizes, since
it is different that using different sigma values in a standard LJ
formula:

Rc is the cutoff which does not include the delta distance.  I.e. the
actual force cutoff is the sum of cutoff + delta.

The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atoms
types via the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command as in the examples
above, or in the data file or restart files read by the
"read_data"_read_data.html or "read_restart"_read_restart.html
commands:

epsilon (energy units)
sigma (distance units)
delta (distance units)
cutoff (distance units) :ul

The delta values can be positive or negative.  The last coefficient is
optional.  If not specified, the global LJ cutoff is used.

[Restrictions:] none
