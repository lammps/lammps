fix lb/pc command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID lb/pc :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in the "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
lb/pc = style name of this fix command :l
:ule

[Examples:]

fix 1 all lb/pc :pre

[Description:]

Update the positions and velocities of the individual particles described
by {group-ID}, experiencing velocity-dependent hydrodynamic forces, 
using the integration algorithm described in "Mackay et al."_#Mackay &#91;1&#93;.  This integration algorithm should only be used if a user-specified value for the force-coupling constant used in "fix lb/fluid"_fix_lb_fluid.html has been set; do not use this integration algorithm if the force coupling constant has been set by default.


[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.  None of the "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html options
are relevant to this fix.  No global or per-atom quantities are stored
by this fix for access by various "output
commands"_Section_howto.html#4_15.  No parameter of this fix can be
used with the {start/stop} keywords of the "run"_run.html command.
This fix is not invoked during "energy minimization"_minimize.html.

[Restrictions:] 

Can only be used if a lattice-Boltzmann fluid has been created via the
"fix lb/fluid"_fix_lb_fluid.html command, and must come after this command. 

 This fix can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
"fluid" package.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#2_3 section for more info on packages.

[Related commands:]

"fix lb/fluid"_fix_lb_fluid.html "fix lb/rigid/pc/sphere"_fix_lb_rigid_pc_sphere.html

[Default:] None.
