fix wall/maxwell command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID wall/maxwell face pos temp velx vely velz keyword value ... :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
wall/maxwell = style name of this fix command :l
one or more face/arg pairs may be appended :l
face = {xlo} or {xhi} or {ylo} or {yhi} or {zlo} or {zhi} :l
  {xlo},{ylo},{zlo} pos = EDGE or constant or variable
    EDGE = current lo edge of simulation box
    constant = number like 0.0 or -30.0 (distance units)
    variable = "equal-style variable"_variable.html like v_x or v_wiggle
    temp = wall temperature
    velx, vely, velz = wall velocity along x, y, z directions
    accom = accommodation coefficient

  {xhi},{yhi},{zhi} pos = EDGE or constant or variable
    EDGE = current hi edge of simulation box
    constant = number like 50.0 or 100.3 (distance units)
    variable = "equal-style variable"_variable.html like v_x or v_wiggle 
    temp = wall temperature 
    velx, vely, velz = wall velocity along x, y, z directions
    accom = accommodation coefficient :pre

zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended :l
keyword = {units} :l
    {units} value = {lattice} or {box}
    {lattice} = the wall position is defined in lattice units
    {box} = the wall position is defined in simulation box units :pre

[Description:]

This is a stochastic wall model which is the mixture of two fixes (and two wall
models) wall/reflect and wall/diffusive, proposed by Maxwell "Maxwell"_#Maxwell.
An atom can be either fully thermalized by the wall and reflected diffusively or
reflected specularly. In this case, the accommodation coefficient (ACCOM) lying
between 0 and 1, is introduced to account for the diffusive reflection portion.
As noted, when ACCOM = 0, the reflection is purely specular and when ACCOM = 1,
the reflection is purely diffusive. The use of this stochastic model is almost
the same as wall/reflect but with five additional parameters the wall
temperature and the wall velocity along 3 directions x, y, z, and the
accommodation coefficient.

The {units} keyword determines the distance units used to define a wall position

A {box} value selects standard distance units as defined by the
"units"_units.html command, e.g. Angstroms for units = real or metal. 

A {lattice} value means the distance units are in lattice spacings. The
"lattice"_lattice.html command must have been previously used to define the
lattice spacings.

[Restrictions:]

Due to its properties, this fix has has the same limitation as the the
wall/reflect. Any dimension (xyz) that has a wall must be non-periodic. It
shoudld not be used with rigid bodies such as those defined by a "fix rigid"
command.
