Package details :h3

Here is a brief description of all the standard and user packages in
LAMMPS.  It lists authors (if applicable) and summarizes the package
contents.  It has specific instructions on how to install the package,
including, if necessary, info on how to download or build any extra
library it requires.  It also gives links to documentation, example
scripts, and pictures/movies (if available) that illustrate use of the
package.

The majority of packages can be included in a LAMMPS build with a
single setting (-D PGK_NAME for CMake) or command ("make yes-name" for
make).  See the "Build package"_Build_package.html doc page for more
info.  A few packages may require additional steps; this is indicated
in the descriptions below.  The "Build extras"_Build_extras.html doc
page gives those details.

NOTE: To see the complete list of commands a package adds to LAMMPS,
you can examine the files in its src directory, e.g. "ls
src/GRANULAR".  Files with names that start with fix, compute, atom,
pair, bond, angle, etc correspond to commands with the same style name
as contained in the file name.

have styles optimized for CPUs, KNLs, and GPUs.

You must have a C++11 compatible compiler to use this package.
KOKKOS makes extensive use of advanced C++ features, which can
expose compiler bugs, especially when compiling for maximum
performance at high optimization levels. Please see the file
lib/kokkos/README for a list of compilers and their respective
platforms, that are known to work.

[Authors:] The KOKKOS package was created primarily by Christian Trott
and Stan Moore (Sandia), with contributions from other folks as well.
It uses the open-source "Kokkos library"_https://github.com/kokkos
which was developed by Carter Edwards, Christian Trott, and others at

USER-MOLFILE package :link(PKG-USER-MOLFILE),h4

[Contents:]

A "dump molfile"_dump_molfile.html command which uses molfile plugins
that are bundled with the "VMD"_vmd_home
molecular visualization and analysis program, to enable LAMMPS to dump
snapshots in formats compatible with various molecular simulation
tools.

To use this package you must have the desired VMD plugins available on
your system.

Note that this package only provides the interface code, not the
plugins themselves, which will be accessed when requesting a specific
plugin via the "dump molfile"_dump_molfile.html command.  Plugins can
be obtained from a VMD installation which has to match the platform
that you are using to compile LAMMPS for. By adding plugins to VMD,
support for new file formats can be added to LAMMPS (or VMD or other
programs that use them) without having to re-compile the application
itself.  More information about the VMD molfile plugins can be found
at

USER-OMP package :link(PKG-USER-OMP),h4

[Contents:]

Hundreds of pair, fix, compute, bond, angle, dihedral, improper, and
kspace styles which are altered to enable threading on many-core CPUs
via OpenMP directives.  All of them have an "omp" in their style name.
The "Speed omp"_Speed_omp.html doc page gives details of what hardware
and compilers are required on your system, and how to build and use
this package.  Its styles can be invoked at run time via the "-sf omp"
or "-suffix omp" "command-line switches"_Run_options.html.  Also see
the "KOKKOS"_#PKG-KOKKOS, "OPT"_#PKG-OPT, and "USER-INTEL"_#PKG-USER-INTEL
packages, which have styles optimized for CPUs.

[Author:] Axel Kohlmeyer (Temple U).

NOTE: To enable multi-threading support the compile flag "-fopenmp"
and the link flag "-fopenmp" (for GNU compilers, you have to look up
the equivalent flags for other compilers) must be used to build LAMMPS.
When using Intel compilers, also the "-restrict" flag is required.
The USER-OMP package can be compiled without enabling OpenMP; then
all code will be compiled as serial and the only improvement over the
regular styles are some data access optimization. These flags should
be added to the CCFLAGS and LINKFLAGS lines of your Makefile.machine.
See src/MAKE/OPTIONS/Makefile.omp for an example.

Once you have an appropriate Makefile.machine, you can
install/un-install the package and build LAMMPS in the usual manner:

USER-QMMM package :link(PKG-USER-QMMM),h4

[Contents:]

A "fix qmmm"_fix_qmmm.html command which allows LAMMPS to be used in a
QM/MM simulation, currently only in combination with the "Quantum
ESPRESSO"_espresso package.

:link(espresso,http://www.quantum-espresso.org)

To use this package you must have Quantum ESPRESSO available on your
system.

The current implementation only supports an ONIOM style mechanical
coupling to the Quantum ESPRESSO plane wave DFT package.
Electrostatic coupling is in preparation and the interface has been
written in a manner that coupling to other QM codes should be possible
without changes to LAMMPS itself.

USER-QTB package :link(PKG-USER-QTB),h4

[Contents:]

Two fixes which provide a self-consistent quantum treatment of
vibrational modes in a classical molecular dynamics simulation.  By
coupling the MD simulation to a colored thermostat, it introduces zero
point energy into the system, altering the energy power spectrum and
the heat capacity to account for their quantum nature. This is useful
when modeling systems at temperatures lower than their classical
limits or when temperatures ramp across the classical limits in a
simulation.

USER-SCAFACOS package :link(PKG-USER-SCAFACOS),h4

[Contents:]

A KSpace style which wraps the "ScaFaCoS Coulomb solver
library"_http://www.scafacos.de to compute long-range Coulombic
interactions.

To use this package you must have the ScaFaCoS library available on
your system.

[Author:] Rene Halver (JSC) wrote the scafacos LAMMPS command.

ScaFaCoS itself was developed by a consortium of German research
facilities with a BMBF (German Ministry of Science and Education)
funded project in 2009-2012. Participants of the consortium were the
Universities of Bonn, Chemnitz, Stuttgart, and Wuppertal as well as
the Forschungszentrum Juelich.

USER-SMD package :link(PKG-USER-SMD),h4

[Contents:]

An atom style, fixes, computes, and several pair styles which
implements smoothed Mach dynamics (SMD) for solids, which is a model
related to smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) for liquids (see the
"USER-SPH package"_#PKG-USER-SPH).

This package solves solids mechanics problems via a state of the art
stabilized meshless method with hourglass control.  It can specify
hydrostatic interactions independently from material strength models,
i.e. pressure and deviatoric stresses are separated.  It provides many
material models (Johnson-Cook, plasticity with hardening,
Mie-Grueneisen, Polynomial EOS) and allows new material models to be
added.  It implements rigid boundary conditions (walls) which can be
specified as surface geometries from *.STL files.

Dynamics, Ernst Mach Institute, Germany).

USER-SPH package :link(PKG-USER-SPH),h4

[Contents:]

An atom style, fixes, computes, and several pair styles which
implements smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) for liquids.  See the
related "USER-SMD package"_#PKG-USER-SMD package for smooth Mach dynamics
(SMD) for solids.

This package contains ideal gas, Lennard-Jones equation of states,
Tait, and full support for complete (i.e. internal-energy dependent)
equations of state.  It allows for plain or Monaghans XSPH integration
of the equations of motion.  It has options for density continuity or
density summation to propagate the density field.  It has
"set"_set.html command options to set the internal energy and density
of particles from the input script and allows the same quantities to
be output with thermodynamic output or to dump files via the "compute
property/atom"_compute_property_atom.html command.
