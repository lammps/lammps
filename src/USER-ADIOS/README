This package provides the adios dump and read_dump styles.

See the doc page for the "dump adios" and "read_dump ... format adios" commands. 
These styles require having ADIOS 2.x itself installed on your system.

Configure LAMMPS with CMake 
 a. set the environment variable 
        ADIOS2_DIR 
    to the ADIOS 2.x installation path
 b. use the cmake option 
       -D PKG_USER-ADIOS=yes 

The person who created this package is Norbert Podhorszki (Oak Ridge National Laboratory);
