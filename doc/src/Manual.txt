"What is a LAMMPS version?"_Manual_version.html

LAMMPS stands for Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel
Simulator.

LAMMPS is a classical molecular dynamics simulation code with a focus
on materials modeling.  It was designed to run efficiently on parallel
computers.  It was developed originally at Sandia National
Laboratories, a US Department of Energy facility.  The majority of
funding for LAMMPS has come from the US Department of Energy (DOE).
LAMMPS is an open-source code, distributed freely under the terms of
the GNU Public License (GPL).

The "LAMMPS website"_lws has a variety of information about the code.
It includes links to an on-line version of this manual, a "mailing
list"_http://lammps.sandia.gov/mail.html where users can post
questions, and a "GitHub site"_https://github.com/lammps/lammps where
all LAMMPS development is coordinated.

The content for this manual is part of the LAMMPS distribution.  You
can build a local copy of the Manual as HTML pages or a PDF file, by
following the steps on the "Manual build"_Manual_build.html doc page.
There is also a "Developer.pdf"_Developer.pdf document which gives
a brief description of the basic code structure of LAMMPS.

Once you are familiar with LAMMPS, you may want to bookmark "this
page"_Commands.html since it gives quick access to a doc page for
every LAMMPS command.
