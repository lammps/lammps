<H3>pair_style sw command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>pair_style sw 
</PRE>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>pair_style sw
pair_coeff * * si.sw Si
pair_coeff * * SiC.sw Si C Si 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>The <I>sw</I> style computes a 3-body <A HREF = "#Stillinger">Stillinger-Weber</A>
potential for the energy E of a system of atoms as
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/pair_sw.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>where phi2 is a two-body term and phi3 is a three-body term.  The
summations in the formula are over all neighbors J and K of atom I
within a cutoff distance = a*sigma.
</P>
<P>Only a single pair_coeff command is used with the <I>sw</I> style which
specifies a Stillinger-Weber potential file with parameters for all
needed elements.  These are mapped to LAMMPS atom types by specifying
N additional arguments after the filename in the pair_coeff command,
where N is the number of LAMMPS atom types:
</P>
<UL><LI>filename
<LI>N element names = mapping of SW elements to atom types 
</UL>
<P>As an example, imagine the SiC.sw file has Stillinger-Weber values for
Si and C.  If your LAMMPS simulation has 4 atoms types and you want
the 1st 3 to be Si, and the 4th to be C, you would use the following
pair_coeff command:
</P>
<PRE>pair_coeff * * SiC.sw Si Si Si C 
</PRE>
<P>The 1st 2 arguments must be * * so as to span all LAMMPS atom types.
The first three Si arguments map LAMMPS atom types 1,2,3 to the Si
element in the SW file.  The final C argument maps LAMMPS atom type 4
to the C element in the SW file.  If a mapping value is specified as
NULL, the mapping is not performed.  This can be used when a <I>sw</I>
potential is used as part of the <I>hybrid</I> pair style.  The NULL values
are placeholders for atom types that will be used with other
potentials.
</P>
<P>Stillinger-Weber files in the <I>potentials</I> directory of the LAMMPS
distribution have a ".sw" suffix.  Lines that are not blank or
comments (starting with #) define parameters for a triplet of
elements.  The parameters in a single entry correspond to the two-body
and three-body coefficients in the formula above:
</P>
<UL><LI>element 1 (the center atom in a 3-body interaction)
<LI>element 2
<LI>element 3
<LI>epsilon (energy units)
<LI>sigma (distnace units)
<LI>a
<LI>lambda
<LI>gamma
<LI>costheta0
<LI>A
<LI>B
<LI>p
<LI>q 
</UL>
<P>The non-annotated parameters are unitless.
</P>
<P>The Stillinger-Weber potential file must contain entries for all the
elements listed in the pair_coeff command.  It can also contain
entries for additional elements not being used in a particular
simulation; LAMMPS ignores those entries.
</P>
<P>For a single-element simulation, only a single entry is required
(e.g. SiSiSi).  For a two-element simulation, the file must contain 8
entries (for SiSiSi, SiSiC, SiCSi, SiCC, CSiSi, CSiC, CCSi, CCC), that
specify SW parameters for all permutations of the two elements
interacting in three-body configurations.  Thus for 3 elements, 27
entries would be required, etc.
</P>
<P>As annotated above, the first element in the entry is the center atom
in a three-body interaction.  Thus an entry for SiCC means a Si atom
with 2 C atoms as neighbors.  By symmetry, three-body parameters for
SiCSi and SiSiC entries should be the same.  Two-body parameters for
an interaction come from the entry where the 2nd element is repeated.
Thus the two-body parameters for Si interacting with C, comes from the
SiCC entry.  Again by symmetry, the two-body parameters in the SiCC
and CSiSi entries should thus be the same.  Two-body parameters in
entries whose 2nd and 3rd element are different (e.g. SiCSi) are
ignored.
