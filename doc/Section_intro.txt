1.1 What is LAMMPS :link(intro_1),h4

LAMMPS is a classical molecular dynamics code that models an ensemble
of particles in a liquid, solid, or gaseous state.  It can model
atomic, polymeric, biological, metallic, granular, and coarse-grained
systems using a variety of force fields and boundary conditions.

For examples of LAMMPS simulations, see the Publications page of the
"LAMMPS WWW Site"_lws.

LAMMPS runs efficiently on single-processor desktop or laptop
machines, but is designed for parallel computers.  It will run on any
parallel machine that compiles C++ and supports the "MPI"_mpi
message-passing library.  This includes distributed- or shared-memory
parallel machines and Beowulf-style clusters.

:link(mpi,http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi)

LAMMPS can model systems with only a few particles up to millions or
billions.  See "Section_perf"_Section_perf.html for information on
LAMMPS performance and scalability, or the Benchmarks section of the
"LAMMPS WWW Site"_lws.

LAMMPS is a freely-available open-source code, distributed under the
terms of the "GNU Public License"_gnu, which means you can use or
modify the code however you wish.  See "this section"_#intro_4 for a
brief discussion of the open-source philosophy.

:link(gnu,http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html)

LAMMPS is designed to be easy to modify or extend with new
capabilities, such as new force fields, atom types, boundary
conditions, or diagnostics.  See "Section_modify"_Section_modify.html
for more details.

The current version of LAMMPS is written in C++.  Earlier versions
were written in F77 and F90.  See
"Section_history"_Section_history.html for more information on
different versions.  All versions can be downloaded from the "LAMMPS
WWW Site"_lws.

LAMMPS was originally developed under a US Department of Energy CRADA
(Cooperative Research and Development Agreement) between two DOE labs
and 3 companies.  It is distributed by "Sandia National Labs"_snl.
See "this section"_#intro_5 for more information on LAMMPS funding and
individuals who have contributed to LAMMPS.

:link(snl,http://www.sandia.gov)

In the most general sense, LAMMPS integrates Newton's equations of
motion for collections of atoms, molecules, or macroscopic particles
that interact via short- or long-range forces with a variety of
initial and/or boundary conditions.  For computational efficiency
LAMMPS uses neighbor lists to keep track of nearby particles.  The
lists are optimized for systems with particles that are repulsive at
short distances, so that the local density of particles never becomes
too large.  On parallel machines, LAMMPS uses spatial-decomposition
techniques to partition the simulation domain into small 3d
sub-domains, one of which is assigned to each processor.  Processors
communicate and store "ghost" atom information for atoms that border
their sub-domain.  LAMMPS is most efficient (in a parallel sense) for
systems whose particles fill a 3d rectangular box with roughly uniform
density.  Papers with technical details of the algorithms used in
LAMMPS are listed in "this section"_#intro_5.

1.3 LAMMPS non-features :link(intro_3),h4

LAMMPS is designed to efficiently compute Newton's equations of motion
for a system of interacting particles.  Many of the tools needed to
pre- and post-process the data for such simulations are not included
in the LAMMPS kernel for several reasons:

the desire to keep LAMMPS simple
they are not parallel operations
other codes already do them
limited development resources :ul

Specifically, LAMMPS itself does not:

run thru a GUI
build molecular systems
assign force-field coefficients automagically
perform sophisticated analyses of your MD simulation
visualize your MD simulation
plot your output data :ul

A few tools for pre- and post-processing tasks are provided as part of
the LAMMPS package; they are described in "this
section"_Section_tools.html.  However, many people use other codes or
write their own tools for these tasks.

As noted above, our group has also written and released a separate
toolkit called "Pizza.py"_pizza which addresses some of the listed
bullets.  It provides tools for doing setup, analysis, plotting, and
visualization for LAMMPS simulations.  Pizza.py is written in
"Python"_python and is available for download from "the Pizza.py WWW
site"_pizza.

LAMMPS requires as input a list of initial atom coordinates and types,
molecular topology information, and force-field coefficients assigned
to all atoms and bonds.  LAMMPS will not build molecular systems and
assign force-field parameters for you.

For atomic systems LAMMPS provides a "create_atoms"_create_atoms.html
command which places atoms on solid-state lattices (fcc, bcc,
user-defined, etc).  Assigning small numbers of force field
coefficients can be done via the "pair coeff"_pair_coeff.html, "bond
coeff"_bond_coeff.html, "angle coeff"_angle_coeff.html, etc commands.
For molecular systems or more complicated simulation geometries, users
typically use another code as a builder and convert its output to
LAMMPS input format, or write their own code to generate atom
coordinate and molecular topology for LAMMPS to read in.

For complicated molecular systems (e.g. a protein), a multitude of
topology information and hundreds of force-field coefficients must
typically be specified.  We suggest you use a program like
"CHARMM"_charmm or "AMBER"_amber or other molecular builders to setup
such problems and dump its information to a file.  You can then
reformat the file as LAMMPS input.  Some of the tools in "this
section"_Section_tools.html can assist in this process.

Similarly, LAMMPS creates output files in a simple format.  Most users
post-process these files with their own analysis tools or re-format
them for input into other programs, including visualization packages.
If you are convinced you need to compute something on-the-fly as
LAMMPS runs, see "Section_modify"_Section_modify.html for a discussion
of how you can use the "dump"_dump.html and "compute"_compute.html and
"fix"_fix.html commands to print out data of your choosing.  Keep in
mind that complicated computations can slow down the molecular
dynamics timestepping, particularly if the computations are not
parallel, so it is often better to leave such analysis to
post-processing codes.

A very simple (yet fast) visualizer is provided with the LAMMPS
package - see the "xmovie"_Section_tools.html#xmovie tool in "this
section"_Section_tools.html.  It creates xyz projection views of
atomic coordinates and animates them.  We find it very useful for
debugging purposes.  For high-quality visualization we recommend the
following packages:

"VMD"_http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd
"AtomEye"_http://mt.seas.upenn.edu/Archive/Graphics/A
"PyMol"_http://pymol.sourceforge.net
"Raster3d"_http://www.bmsc.washington.edu/raster3d/raster3d.html
"RasMol"_http://www.openrasmol.org :ul

Other features that LAMMPS does not yet (and may never) support are
discussed in "Section_history"_Section_history.html.

Finally, these are freely-available molecular dynamics codes, most of
them parallel, which may be well-suited to the problems you want to
model.  They can also be used in conjunction with LAMMPS to perform
complementary modeling tasks.

"CHARMM"_charmm
"AMBER"_amber
"NAMD"_namd
"NWCHEM"_nwchem
"DL_POLY"_dlpoly
"Tinker"_tinker :ul

:link(charmm,http://www.scripps.edu/brooks)
:link(amber,http://amber.scripps.edu)
:link(namd,http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/)
:link(nwchem,http://www.emsl.pnl.gov/docs/nwchem/nwchem.html)
:link(dlpoly,http://www.cse.clrc.ac.uk/msi/software/DL_POLY)
:link(tinker,http://dasher.wustl.edu/tinker)

CHARMM, AMBER, NAMD, NWCHEM, and Tinker are designed primarily for
modeling biological molecules.  CHARMM and AMBER use
atom-decomposition (replicated-data) strategies for parallelism; NAMD
and NWCHEM use spatial-decomposition approaches, similar to LAMMPS.
Tinker is a serial code.  DL_POLY includes potentials for a variety of
biological and non-biological materials; both a replicated-data and
spatial-decomposition version exist.

1.4 Open source distribution :link(intro_4),h4

LAMMPS comes with no warranty of any kind.  As each source file states
in its header, it is a copyrighted code that is distributed free-of-
charge, under the terms of the "GNU Public License"_gnu (GPL).  This
is often referred to as open-source distribution - see
"www.gnu.org"_gnuorg or "www.opensource.org"_opensource for more
details.  The legal text of the GPL is in the LICENSE file that is
included in the LAMMPS distribution.

:link(gnuorg,http://www.gnu.org)
:link(opensource,http://www.opensource.org)

Here is a summary of what the GPL means for LAMMPS users:

(1) Anyone is free to use, modify, or extend LAMMPS in any way they
choose, including for commercial purposes.

(2) If you distribute a modified version of LAMMPS, it must remain
open-source, meaning you distribute it under the terms of the GPL.
You should clearly annotate such a code as a derivative version of
LAMMPS.

(3) If you release any code that includes LAMMPS source code, then it
must also be open-sourced, meaning you distribute it under the terms
of the GPL.

(4) If you give LAMMPS files to someone else, the GPL LICENSE file and
source file headers (including the copyright and GPL notices) should
remain part of the code.

In the spirit of an open-source code, these are various ways you can
contribute to making LAMMPS better.  You can send email to the
"developers"_http://lammps.sandia.gov/authors.html on any of these
items.

Point prospective users to the "LAMMPS WWW Site"_lws.  Mention it in
talks or link to it from your WWW site. :ulb,l

If you find an error or omission in this manual or on the "LAMMPS WWW
Site"_lws, or have a suggestion for something to clarify or include,
