This package contains a implementation for LAMMPS of the ReaxFF force
field.  ReaxFF uses distance-dependent bond-order functions to
represent the contributions of chemical bonding to the potential
energy.  It was originally developed by Adri van Duin and the Goddard
group at CalTech.

The USER-REAXC-HIP version of ReaxFF (pair_style reax/c/hip), implemented in
HIP, should give identical or very similar results to pair_style reax,
which is a ReaxFF implementation on top of a Fortran library, a
version of which library was originally authored by Adri van Duin.

The reax/c/hip version should be somewhat faster and more scalable,
particularly with respect to the charge equilibration calculation.  It
should also be easier to build and use since there are no complicating
issues with Fortran memory allocation or linking to a Fortran library.

For technical details about this implementation of ReaxFF, see
this paper:

Parallel and Scalable Reactive Molecular Dynamics: Numerical Methods
and Algorithmic Techniques, H. M. Aktulga, J. C. Fogarty,
S. A. Pandit, A. Y. Grama, Parallel Computing, in press (2011).

See the doc page for the pair_style reax/c/hip command for details
of how to use it in LAMMPS.

Currently the HIP version supports only qeq fix.


The package uses the "reaxcgpuhip" library, whose source code is included
in the LAMMPS source code distribution and must be linked with LAMMPS.
See the lib/reaxcgpuhib/README file and the LAMMPS manual for information
on building LAMMPS with external libraries.  The settings in the
Makefile.lammps file in that directory must be correct for LAMMPS to
build correctly with this package installed. The reaxcgpuhip library uses code
from the original PG-PuReMD package.

The files in the USER-REAXC-HIP package folder implement an interface
between LAMMPS and PG-PuReMD. PG-PuReMD is the GPU CUDA version of the 
PuReMD package originally written by Hasan Metin Aktulga(hma@cse.msu.edu). The
original PG-PuReMD CUDA code was ported to HIP by Trinayan Baruah(baruah.t@northeastern.edu)


The files in the USER-REAXC-HIP have been modified based on code from the USER-REAXC package in LAMMPS 
which is the serial CPU implementation of REAXC in LAMMPS developed by Stan Moore(stamoor@sandia.gov).
These files simply make calls to the GPU functionality implemented in lib/reaxcgpuhip.


Currently only full neighbor lists are supported. The latest version of PG-PuReMD does have support for half
neighbor lists on the GPU. But the code in lib/reaxcgpuhip is not the latest version of PG-PuReMD. Half list
support may be added in the future.


Currently the application expects the number of MPI processes to be equal to the number of GPUs. The number of
GPUs is set in the control file passed as an input to LAMMPS using the parameter "gpus_per_node". This can be
seen under examples/reaxgpuhip/RDX/control.reax_c.rdx where this value is set to 1. If the user wants to use 
multiple MPI processes say "mpirun -np 2", then this parameter should be set to 2 accordingly 


The people involved in creating this HIP version of REAXC are Trinayan Baruah(baruah.t@northeastern.edu),
David Kaeli(kaeli@ece.neu.edu) and Nicholas Curtis(nicholas.curtis@amd.com). Contact them if you have any 
questions.

Thanks to Stan Moore for his input on the
LAMMPS architecture and for their help in understanding and
customizing some of the required LAMMPS interfaces.

Thanks to Hasan Metin Aktulga and Kurt O Hearn for their input on understanding the PG-PuReMD codebase
so that it could be ported to HIP and integrated into LAMMPS
