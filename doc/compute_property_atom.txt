[Description:]

Define a computation that simply stores atom attributes for each atom
in the group.  This is useful so that the values can be used by other
"output commands"_Section_howto.html#howto_15 that take computes as
inputs.  See for example, the "compute reduce"_compute_reduce.html,
"fix ave/atom"_fix_ave_atom.html, "fix ave/histo"_fix_ave_histo.html,
"fix ave/spatial"_fix_ave_spatial.html, and "atom-style
variable"_variable.html commands.

The list of possible attributes is the same as that used by the "dump
custom"_dump.html command, which describes their meaning, with some
additional quantities that are only defined for certain "atom
styles"_atom_style.html.  Basically, this list gives your input script
access to any per-atom quantity stored by LAMMPS.

The values are stored in a per-atom vector or array as discussed
below.  Zeroes are stored for atoms not in the specified group or for
quantities that are not defined for a particular particle in the group
(e.g. {shapex} if the particle is not an ellipsoid).

The additional quantities only accessible via this command, and not
directly via the "dump custom"_dump.html command, are as follows.

{Shapex}, {shapey}, and {shapez} are defined for ellipsoidal particles
and define the 3d shape of each particle.

{Quatw}, {quati}, {quatj}, and {quatk} are defined for ellipsoidal
particles and body particles and store the 4-vector quaternion
representing the orientation of each particle.  See the "set"_set.html
command for an explanation of the quaternion vector.

{End1x}, {end1y}, {end1z}, {end2x}, {end2y}, {end2z}, are defined for
line segment particles and define the end points of each line segment.

{Corner1x}, {corner1y}, {corner1z}, {corner2x}, {corner2y},
{corner2z}, {corner3x}, {corner3y}, {corner3z}, are defined for
triangular particles and define the corner points of each triangle.

The {i_name} and {d_name} attributes refer to custom integer and
floating-point properties that have been added to each atom via the
"fix property/atom"_fix_property_atom.html command.  When that command
is used specific names are given to each attribute which are what is
specified as the "name" portion of {i_name} or {d_name}.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a per-atom vector or per-atom array depending
on the number of input values.  If a single input is specified, a
per-atom vector is produced.  If two or more inputs are specified, a
per-atom array is produced where the number of columns = the number of
inputs.  The vector or array can be accessed by any command that uses
per-atom values from a compute as input.  See "this
section"_Section_howto.html#howto_15 for an overview of LAMMPS output
options.

The vector or array values will be in whatever "units"_units.html the
corresponding attribute is in, e.g. velocity units for vx, charge
units for q, etc.
