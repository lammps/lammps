<H3>molecule command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>molecule ID file1 file2 ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID = user-assigned name for the molecule template
<LI>file1,file2,... = names of files containing molecule descriptions 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>molecule 1 mymol
molecule 1 co2.txt h2o.txt
molecule CO2 co2.txt 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a molecule template that can be used as part of other LAMMPS
commands, typically to define a collection of particles as a bonded
molecule or a rigid body.  Commands that currently use molecule
templates include:
</P>
<UL><LI><A HREF = "fix_deposit.html">fix deposit</A>
<LI><A HREF = "fix_pour.html">fix pour</A>
<LI><A HREF = "fix_rigid.html">fix rigid/small</A>
<LI><A HREF = "fix_shake.html">fix shake</A>
<LI><A HREF = "fix_gcmc.html">fix gcmc</A>
<LI><A HREF = "create_atoms.html">create_atoms</A> 
<LI><A HREF = "atom_style.html">atom_style template</A> 
</UL>
<P>The ID of a molecule template can only contain alphanumeric characters
and underscores.
</P>
<P>A single template can contain multiple molecules, listed one per file.
Many of the commands listed above currently use only the first
molecule in the template, and will issue a warning if the template
contains multiple molecules.  The <A HREF = "atom_style.html">atom_style
template</A> command allows multiple-molecule templates
to define a system with more than one templated molecule.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: When using the <A HREF = "atom_style.html">atom_style template</A>
command with a molecule template that contains multiple molecules, you
should insure the atom types, bond types, angle_types, etc in all the
molecules are consistent.  E.g. if one molecule represents H2O and
another CO2, then you probably do not want each molecule file to
define 2 atom types and a single bond type, because they will conflict
with each other when a mixture system of H2O and CO2 molecules is
defined, e.g.  by the <A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> command.  Rather the
H2O molecule should define atom types 1 and 2, and bond type 1.  And
the CO2 molecule should define atom types 3 and 4 (or atom types 3 and
2 if a single oxygen type is desired), and bond type 2.
</P>
<P>The format of an individual molecule file is similar to the data file
read by the <A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> commands, and is as follows.
</P>
<P>A molecule file has a header and a body.  The header appears first.
The first line of the header is always skipped; it typically contains
a description of the file.  Then lines are read one at a time.  Lines
can have a trailing comment starting with '#' that is ignored.  If the
line is blank (only whitespace after comment is deleted), it is
skipped.  If the line contains a header keyword, the corresponding
value(s) is read from the line.  If it doesn't contain a header
keyword, the line begins the body of the file.
</P>
<P>The body of the file contains zero or more sections.  The first line
of a section has only a keyword.  The next line is skipped.  The
remaining lines of the section contain values.  The number of lines
depends on the section keyword as described below.  Zero or more blank
lines can be used between sections.  Sections can appear in any order,
with a few exceptions as noted below.
</P>
<P>These are the recognized header keywords.  Header lines can come in
any order.  The numeric value(s) are read from the beginning of the
line.  The keyword should appear at the end of the line.  All these
settings have default values, as explained below.  A line need only
appear if the value(s) are different than the default.
</P>
<UL><LI>N <I>atoms</I> = # of atoms N in molecule, default = 0
<LI>Nb <I>bonds</I> = # of bonds Nb in molecule, default = 0
<LI>Na <I>angles</I> = # of angles Na in molecule, default = 0
<LI>Nd <I>dihedrals</I> = # of dihedrals Nd in molecule, default = 0
<LI>Ni <I>impropers</I> = # of impropers Ni in molecule, default = 0
<LI>Mtotal <I>mass</I> = total mass of molecule
<LI>Xc Yc Zc <I>com</I> = coordinates of center-of-mass of molecule
<LI>Ixx Iyy Izz Ixy Ixz Iyz <I>inertia</I> = 6 components of inertia tensor of molecule 
</UL>
<P>For <I>mass</I>, <I>com</I>, and <I>inertia</I>, the default is for LAMMPS to
calculate this quantity itself if needed, assuming the molecules
consists of a set of point particles.  You typically only need to
specify these values for a rigid body consisting of overlapping
finite-size particles.
</P>
<P>The mass and center-of-mass coordinates (Xc,Yc,Zc) are
self-explanatory.  The 6 moments of inertia (ixx,iyy,izz,ixy,ixz,iyz)
should be the values consistent with the current orientation of the
rigid body around its center of mass.  The values are with respect to
the simulation box XYZ axes, not with respect to the prinicpal axes of
the rigid body itself.  LAMMPS performs the latter calculation
internally.
</P>
<P>These are the allowed section keywords for the body of the file.
</P>
<UL><LI><I>Coords, Types, Charges, Diameters, Masses</I> = atom-property sections 
<LI><I>Bonds, Angles, Dihedrals, Impropers</I> = molecular topology sections 
<LI><I>Special Bond Counts, Special Bonds</I> = special neighbor info
<LI><I>Shake Flags, Shake Atoms, Shake Bond Types</I> = SHAKE info 
</UL>
<P>If a Bonds section is specified then the Special Bond Counts and
Special Bonds sections must be also, since the latter is needed for
LAMMPS to properly exclude or weight bonded pairwise interactions
between bonded atoms.  See the <A HREF = "special_bonds.html">special_bonds</A>
command for more details.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: Whether a section is required depends on how the
molecule template is used by other LAMMPS commands.  For example, to
add a molecule via the <A HREF = "fix_deposit.html">fix deposit</A> command, the
Coords and Types sections are required.  To add a rigid body via the
<A HREF = "fix_pout.html">fix pour</A> command, the Bonds (Angles, etc) sections are
not required, since the molecule will be treated as a rigid body.
Some sections are optional.  For example, the <A HREF = "fix_pour.html">fix pour</A>
command can be used to add "molecules" which are clusters of
finite-size granular particles.  If the Diameters section is not
specified, each particle in the molecule will have a default diameter
of 1.0.  See the doc pages for LAMMPS commands that use molecule
templates for more details.
</P>
<P>Each section is listed below in alphabetic order.  The format of each
section is described including the number of lines it must contain and
rules (if any) for whether it can appear in the data file.  In each
case the ID is ignored; it is simply included for readability, and
should be a number from 1 to Nlines for the section, indicating which
atom (or bond, etc) the entry applies to.  The lines are assumed to be
listed in order from 1 to Nlines, but LAMMPS does not check for this.

<LI>q = charge on atom 
</UL>
<P>This section is only allowed for <A HREF = "atom_style.html">atom styles</A> that
support charge.  If this section is not included, the default charge
on each atom in the molecule is 0.0.
</P>
<HR>

<P><I>Diameters</I> section:
</P>
<UL><LI>one line per atom
<LI>line syntax: ID diam
<LI>diam = diameter of atom 
</UL>
<P>This section is only allowed for <A HREF = "atom_style.html">atom styles</A> that

<P><I>Masses</I> section:
</P>
<UL><LI>one line per atom
<LI>line syntax: ID mass
<LI>mass = mass of atom 
</UL>
<P>This section is only allowed for <A HREF = "atom_style.html">atom styles</A> that
support per-atom mass, as opposed to per-type mass.  See the
<A HREF = "mass.html">mass</A> command for details.  If this section is not
included, the default mass for each atom is derived from its volume
(see Diameters section) and a default density of 1.0, in
<A HREF = "units.html">units</A> of mass/volume.
</P>
<HR>

<P><I>Bonds</I> section:
</P>
<UL><LI>one line per bond

<LI>type = angle type (1-Nangletype)
<LI>atom1,atom2,atom3 = IDs of atoms in angle 
</UL>
<P>The IDs for the three atoms in each angle should be values from 1 to
Natoms, where Natoms = # of atoms in the molecule.  The 3 atoms are
ordered linearly within the angle.  Thus the central atom (around
which the angle is computed) is the atom2 in the list.

</UL>
<P>The IDs for the four atoms in each improper should be values from 1 to
Natoms, where Natoms = # of atoms in the molecule.  The ordering of

<LI>N3 = # of 1-4 bonds 
</UL>
<P>N1, N2, N3 are the number of 1-2, 1-3, 1-4 neighbors respectively of
this atom within the topology of the molecule.  See the
<A HREF = "special_bonds.html">special_bonds</A> doc page for more discussion of
1-2, 1-3, 1-4 neighbors.  If this section appears, the Special Bonds
section must also appear.  If this section is not specied, the

1-4 neighbors of this atom.  The IDs should be values from 1 to
Natoms, where Natoms = # of atoms in the molecule.  The first N1
values should be the 1-2 neighbors, the next N2 should be the 1-3
neighbors, the last N3 should be the 1-4 neighbors.  No atom ID should
appear more than once.  See the <A HREF = "special_bonds.html">special_bonds</A> doc
page for more discussion of 1-2, 1-3, 1-4 neighbors.  If this section
appears, the Special Bond Counts section must also appear.  If this
