[Description:]

The {coul/cut} style computes the standard Coulombic interaction
potential given by

:c,image(Eqs/pair_coulomb.jpg)

where C is an energy-conversion constant, Qi and Qj are the charges on
the 2 atoms, and epsilon is the dielectric constant which can be set
by the "dielectric"_dielectric.html command.  The cutoff Rc truncates
the interaction distance.

Style {coul/debye} adds an additional exp() damping factor to the
Coulombic term, given by

:c,image(Eqs/pair_debye.jpg)

where kappa is the Debye length.  This potential is another way to
mimic the screening effect of a polar solvent.

Style {coul/dsf} computes Coulombic interactions via the damped 
shifted force model described in "Fennell"_#Fennell, given by:

:c,image(Eqs/pair_coul_dsf.jpg)

where {alpha} is the damping parameter and erfc() is the
complementary error-function. The potential corrects issues in the
Wolf model (described below) to provide consistent forces and energies
(the Wolf potential is not differentiable at the cutoff) and smooth
decay to zero.

Style {coul/wolf} computes Coulombic interactions via the Wolf
summation method, described in "Wolf"_#Wolf, given by:

:c,image(Eqs/pair_coul_wolf.jpg)

where {alpha} is the damping parameter, and erc() and erfc() are
error-fuction and complementary error-function terms.  This potential
is essentially a short-range, spherically-truncated,
charge-neutralized, shifted, pairwise {1/r} summation.  With a
manipulation of adding and substracting a self term (for i = j) to the
first and second term on the right-hand-side, respectively, and a
small enough {alpha} damping parameter, the second term shrinks and
the potential becomes a rapidly-converging real-space summation.  With
a long enough cutoff and small enough alpha parameter, the energy and
forces calcluated by the Wolf summation method approach those of the
Ewald sum.  So it is a means of getting effective long-range
interactions with a short-range potential.

Styles {coul/long} and {coul/msm} compute the same Coulombic
interactions as style {coul/cut} except that an additional damping
factor is applied so it can be used in conjunction with the
"kspace_style"_kspace_style.html command and its {ewald} or {pppm}
option.  The Coulombic cutoff specified for this style means that
pairwise interactions within this distance are computed directly;
interactions outside that distance are computed in reciprocal space.

These potentials are designed to be combined with other pair
potentials via the "pair_style hybrid/overlay"_pair_hybrid.html
command.  This is because they have no repulsive core.  Hence if they
are used by themselves, there will be no repulsion to keep two
oppositely charged particles from overlapping each other.

The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atoms
types via the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command as in the examples
above, or in the data file or restart files read by the
"read_data"_read_data.html or "read_restart"_read_restart.html
commands, or by mixing as described below:

cutoff (distance units) :ul

For {coul/cut} and {coul/debye}, the cutoff coefficient is optional.
If it is not used (as in some of the examples above), the default
global value specified in the pair_style command is used.

For {coul/long} and {coul/msm} no cutoff can be specified for an
individual I,J type pair via the pair_coeff command.  All type pairs
use the same global Coulombic cutoff specified in the pair_style
command.

Styles with a {cuda}, {gpu}, {omp}, or {opt} suffix are functionally
the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.  They have
been optimized to run faster, depending on your available hardware, as
discussed in "Section_accelerate"_Section_accelerate.html of the
manual.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and should
produce the same results, except for round-off and precision issues.

These accelerated styles are part of the USER-CUDA, GPU, USER-OMP and OPT
packages, respectively.  They are only enabled if LAMMPS was built with
those packages.  See the "Making LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3
section for more info.

You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the "-suffix command-line
switch"_Section_start.html#start_7 when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can
use the "suffix"_suffix.html command in your input script.

See "Section_accelerate"_Section_accelerate.html of the manual for
more instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.

[Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info]:

For atom type pairs I,J and I != J, the cutoff distance for the
{coul/cut} style can be mixed.  The default mix value is {geometric}.
See the "pair_modify" command for details.

The "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html shift option is not relevant
for these pair styles.

The {coul/long} style supports the "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html
table option for tabulation of the short-range portion of the
long-range Coulombic interaction.

These pair styles do not support the "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html
tail option for adding long-range tail corrections to energy and
pressure.

These pair styles write their information to "binary restart
files"_restart.html, so pair_style and pair_coeff commands do not need
to be specified in an input script that reads a restart file.

This pair style can only be used via the {pair} keyword of the
"run_style respa"_run_style.html command.  It does not support the
{inner}, {middle}, {outer} keywords.

[Restrictions:]

The {coul/long} style is part of the KSPACE package.  It is only
enabled if LAMMPS was built with that package (which it is by
default).  See the "Making LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section
for more info.
