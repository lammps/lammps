[Examples:]

fix 2 gas widom 1 50000 1 19494 2.0

[Description:]

This fix performs Widom insertions of
atoms or molecules at the given temperature as discussed
in "(Frenkel)"_#Frenkel. Specific uses include computation of Henry constants 
of small molecules in microporous materials or amorphous systems.

Every N timesteps the fix attempts M number of Widom insertions of atoms or molecules.

If the {mol} keyword is used, only molecule insertions are performed.
Conversely, if the {mol} keyword is not used, only atom
insertions are performed.

This command may optionally use the {region} keyword to define an
insertion volume.  The specified region must have been
previously defined with a "region"_region.html command.  It must be
defined with side = {in}.  Insertion attempts occur only within the
specified region. For non-rectangular regions, random trial points are
generated within the rectangular bounding box until a point is found
that lies inside the region. If no valid point is generated after 1000
trials, no insertion is performed. If an attempted insertion places the 
atom or molecule center-of-mass outside the specified region, a new 
attempted move is generated. This process is repeated until the atom 
or molecule center-of-mass is inside the specified region.

Note that neighbor lists are re-built every timestep that this fix is
invoked, so you should not set N to be too small. 
See the "neighbor"_neighbor.html command for details.

When an atom or molecule is to be inserted, its coordinates are chosen
at a random position within the current simulation cell or region. 
Relative coordinates for atoms in a
molecule are taken from the template molecule provided by the
user. The center of mass of the molecule is placed at the insertion
point. The orientation of the molecule is chosen at random by rotating
about this point. A random point on the
unit sphere is generated and a random rotation angle on the range
\[0,360) is selected. The molecule is then rotated by that angle about an
axis passing through the molecule center of mass. The axis is parallel
to the unit vector defined by the point on the unit sphere.

Individual atoms are inserted, unless the {mol} keyword is used.  It
specifies a {template-ID} previously defined using the
"molecule"_molecule.html command, which reads a file that defines the
molecule.  The coordinates, atom types, charges, etc., as well as any
bonding and special neighbor information for the molecule can
be specified in the molecule file.  See the "molecule"_molecule.html
command for details.  The only settings required to be in this file
are the coordinates and types of atoms in the molecule.
  

Note that fix widom does not use configurational bias MC or any other
kind of sampling of intramolecular degrees of freedom.  Inserted
molecules can have different orientations, but they will all have the
same intramolecular configuration, which was specified in the molecule
command input.

For atoms, inserted particles have the specified atom type. For 
molecules, they use the same atom types as in 
the template molecule supplied by the user. 

The excess chemical potential mu_ex is defined as:

:c,image(Eqs/fix_widom.jpg)

where k_B is Boltzman's constant, T is the user-specified temperature, U_N and U_{N+1}
is the potential energy of the system with N and N+1 particles.

The {full_energy} option means that the fix calculates the total
potential energy of the entire simulated system, instead of just
the energy of the part that is changed. By default, this option is off,
in which case only
partial energies are computed to determine the energy difference
due to the proposed change.

The {full_energy} option is needed for systems with complicated
potential energy calculations, including the following:

  long-range electrostatics (kspace)
  many-body pair styles
  hybrid pair styles
  eam pair styles
  tail corrections
  need to include potential energy contributions from other fixes :ul

In these cases, LAMMPS will automatically apply the {full_energy}
keyword and issue a warning message.

When the {mol} keyword is used, the {full_energy} option also includes
the intramolecular energy of inserted molecules, whereas
this energy is not included when {full_energy} is not used. If this
is not desired, the {intra_energy} keyword can be used to define an
amount of energy that is subtracted from the final energy when a
molecule is inserted, and subtracted from the initial energy when a molecule
is deleted. For molecules that have a non-zero intramolecular energy,
this will ensure roughly the same behavior whether or not the
{full_energy} option is used.

Some fixes have an associated potential energy. Examples of such fixes
include: "efield"_fix_efield.html, "gravity"_fix_gravity.html,
"addforce"_fix_addforce.html, "langevin"_fix_langevin.html,
"restrain"_fix_restrain.html,
"temp/berendsen"_fix_temp_berendsen.html,
"temp/rescale"_fix_temp_rescale.html, and "wall fixes"_fix_wall.html.
For that energy to be included in the total potential energy of the
system (the quantity used when performing Widom insertions),
you MUST enable
the "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html {energy} option for that fix.  The
doc pages for individual "fix"_fix.html commands specify if this
should be done.

Use the {charge} option to insert atoms with a user-specified point
charge. Note that doing so will cause the system to become
non-neutral.  LAMMPS issues a warning when using long-range
electrostatics (kspace) with non-neutral systems. See the "compute
group/group"_compute_group_group.html documentation for more details
about simulating non-neutral systems with kspace on.

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

This fix writes the state of the fix to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.  This includes information about the random
number generator seed, the next timestep for Widom insertion, etc.  See
the "read_restart"_read_restart.html command for info on how to
re-specify a fix in an input script that reads a restart file, so that
the operation of the fix continues in an uninterrupted fashion.

None of the "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html options are relevant to this
fix.

This fix computes a global vector of length 3, which can be accessed
by various "output commands"_Howto_output.html.  The vector values are
the following global cumulative quantities:

1 = average excess chemical potential on each timestep
2 = average difference in potential energy on each timestep
3 = volume of the insertion region :ul

The vector values calculated by this fix are "extensive".

No parameter of this fix can be used with the {start/stop} keywords of
the "run"_run.html command.  This fix is not invoked during "energy
minimization"_minimize.html.

[Restrictions:]

This fix is part of the MC package.  It is only enabled if LAMMPS was
built with that package.  See the "Build package"_Build_package.html
doc page for more info.

Do not set "neigh_modify once yes" or else this fix will never be
called.  Reneighboring is required.

Can be run in parallel, but some aspects will not scale
well. Only usable for 3D simulations.

"fix nvt"_fix_nh.html, "neighbor"_neighbor.html,

[Default:]

The option defaults are mol = no, intra_energy = 0.0.
full_energy = no, except for the situations where full_energy is 
required, as listed above.
