dump cac/nodal/positions command :h3

[Syntax:]

dump ID group-ID cac/nodal/positions N file args :pre

ID = user-assigned name for the dump
group-ID = ID of the group of atoms/elements to be dumped
cac/nodal/positions = style of dump command (other styles {atom} or {cfg} or {dcd} or {xtc} or {xyz} or {local} or {custom} are discussed on the "dump"_dump.html doc page)
N = dump every this many timesteps
file = name of file to write dump info to
args = same as arguments for "dump_style custom"_dump.html :ul

[Examples:]

dump mesh all cac/nodal/positions 1000 CACmesh.txt

[Description:]

Periodically outputs the nodal positions at the specified interval. The nodal positions
of all finite elements for each of their respective internal degrees of freedom will be 
printed; atom positions will also be printed and denoted by the 0 element type following
one line of position data.

NOTE: Unless the "dump_modify sort"_dump_modify.html option
is invoked, the atoms and finite elements will be written in an indeterminate 
order for each snapshot; nodes and internal degrees of freedom will belong to 
their respective finite element however.
