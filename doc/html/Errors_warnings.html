<p>This is an alphabetic list of the WARNING messages LAMMPS prints out
and the reason why.  If the explanation here is not sufficient, the
documentation for the offending command may help.  Warning messages
also list the source file and line number where the warning was
generated.  For example, a message like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>WARNING: Bond atom missing in box size check (domain.cpp:187)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>means that line #187 in the file src/domain.cpp generated the error.
Looking in the source code may help you figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p>Note that warning messages from <a class="reference internal" href="Packages_user.html"><span class="doc">user-contributed packages</span></a> are not listed here.  If such a warning
occurs and is not self-explanatory, you will need to look in the source
code or contact the author of the package.</p>

</dd>
<dt><em>Bond/angle/dihedral extent &gt; half of periodic box length</em></dt><dd><p>This is a restriction because LAMMPS can be confused about which image
of an atom in the bonded interaction is the correct one to use.
“Extent” in this context means the maximum end-to-end length of the
bond/angle/dihedral.  LAMMPS computes this by taking the maximum bond
length, multiplying by the number of bonds in the interaction (e.g. 3
for a dihedral) and adding a small amount of stretch.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>Bond/react: Atom affected by reaction too close to template edge</em></dt><dd><p>This means an atom which changes type or connectivity during the
reaction is too close to an ‘edge’ atom defined in the superimpose
file. This could cause incorrect assignment of bonds, angle, etc.
Generally, this means you must include more atoms in your templates,
such that there are at least two atoms between each atom involved in
the reaction and an edge atom.</p>

initialized as part of a ‘run’ or ‘minimize’ command. Not all dump
styles and features are fully supported at this point and thus the
command may fail or produce incomplete or incorrect output. Insert
a “run 0” command, if a full system init is required.</p>

<dt><em>Communication cutoff is 0.0. No ghost atoms will be generated. Atoms may get lost</em></dt><dd><p>The communication cutoff defaults to the maximum of what is inferred from
pair and bond styles (will be zero, if none are defined) and what is specified
via <a class="reference internal" href="comm_modify.html"><span class="doc">comm_modify cutoff</span></a> (defaults to 0.0).  If this results
to 0.0, no ghost atoms will be generated and LAMMPS may lose atoms or use
incorrect periodic images of atoms in interaction lists.  To avoid, either use
<a class="reference internal" href="pair_zero.html"><span class="doc">pair style zero</span></a> with a suitable cutoff or use <a class="reference internal" href="comm_modify.html"><span class="doc">comm_modify cutoff</span></a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>Communication cutoff is shorter than a bond length based estimate. This may lead to errors.</em></dt><dd><p>Since LAMMPS stores topology data with individual atoms, all atoms
comprising a bond, angle, dihedral or improper must be present on any
sub-domain that “owns” the atom with the information, either as a
local or a ghost atom. The communication cutoff is what determines up
to what distance from a sub-domain boundary ghost atoms are created.
The communication cutoff is by default the largest non-bonded cutoff
plus the neighbor skin distance, but for short or non-bonded cutoffs
and/or long bonds, this may not be sufficient. This warning indicates
that there is an increased risk of a simulation stopping unexpectedly
because of Bond/Angle/Dihedral/Improper atoms missing.  It can be
silenced by manually setting the communication cutoff via
<a class="reference internal" href="comm_modify.html"><span class="doc">comm_modify cutoff</span></a>.  However, since the
heuristic used to determine the estimate is not always accurate, it
is not changed automatically and the warning may be ignored depending
on the specific system being simulated.</p>

the atoms in one or more rigid bodies, so the change in
degrees-of-freedom for the atoms in those partial rigid bodies will
not be accounted for.</p>

</dd>
<dt><em>Inconsistent image flags</em></dt><dd><p>The image flags for a pair on bonded atoms appear to be inconsistent.
Inconsistent means that when the coordinates of the two atoms are
unwrapped using the image flags, the two atoms are far apart.
Specifically they are further apart than half a periodic box length.
Or they are more than a box length apart in a non-periodic dimension.
This is usually due to the initial data file not having correct image
flags for the 2 atoms in a bond that straddles a periodic boundary.
They should be different by 1 in that case.  This is a warning because
inconsistent image flags will not cause problems for dynamics or most
LAMMPS simulations.  However they can cause problems when such atoms
are used with the fix rigid or replicate commands.  Note that if you
have an infinite periodic crystal with bonds then it is impossible to
have fully consistent image flags, since some bonds will cross
periodic boundaries and connect two atoms with the same image
flag.</p>
