<H3>9. Additional tools 
</H3>
<P>LAMMPS is designed to be a computational kernel for performing
molecular dynamics computations.  Additional pre- and post-processing
steps are often necessary to setup and analyze a simulation.  A few
additional tools are provided with the LAMMPS distribution and are
described in this section.
</P>
<P>Our group has also written and released a separate toolkit called
<A HREF = "http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/pizza.html">Pizza.py</A> which provides tools for doing setup, analysis,
plotting, and visualization for LAMMPS simulations.  Pizza.py is
written in <A HREF = "http://www.python.org">Python</A> and is available for download from <A HREF = "http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/pizza.html">the
Pizza.py WWW site</A>.
</P>




<P>Note that many users write their own setup or analysis tools or use
other existing codes and convert their output to a LAMMPS input format
or vice versa.  The tools listed here are included in the LAMMPS
distribution as examples of auxiliary tools.  Some of them are not
actively supported by Sandia, as they were contributed by LAMMPS
users.  If you have problems using them, we can direct you to the
authors.
</P>
<P>The source code for each of these codes is in the tools sub-directory
of the LAMMPS distribution.  There is a Makefile (which you may need
to edit for your platform) which will build several of the tools which
reside in that directory.  Some of them are larger packages in their
own sub-directories with their own Makefiles.

<H4><A NAME = "amber"></A>amber2lmp tool 
</H4>
<P>The amber2lmp sub-directory contains two Python scripts for converting
files back-and-forth between the AMBER MD code and LAMMPS.  See the
README file in amber2lmp for more information.
</P>
<P>These tools were written by Keir Novik while he was at Queen Mary
University of London.  Keir is no longer there and cannot support
these tools which are out-of-date with respect to the current LAMMPS
version (and maybe with respect to AMBER as well).  Since we don't use
these tools at Sandia, you'll need to experiment with them and make
necessary modifications yourself.
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "binary"></A>binary2txt tool 
</H4>
<P>The file binary2txt.cpp converts one or more binary LAMMPS dump file
into ASCII text files.  The syntax for running the tool is
</P>
<PRE>binary2txt file1 file2 ... 
</PRE>
<P>which creates file1.txt, file2.txt, etc.  This tool must be compiled
on a platform that can read the binary file created by a LAMMPS run,
since binary files are not compatible across all platforms.
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "charmm"></A>ch2lmp tool 
</H4>
<P>The ch2lmp sub-directory contains tools for converting files
back-and-forth between the CHARMM MD code and LAMMPS. 
</P>
<P>They are intended to make it easy to use CHARMM as a builder and as a
post-processor for LAMMPS. Using charmm2lammps.pl, you can convert an
ensemble built in CHARMM into its LAMMPS equivalent.  Using
lammps2pdb.pl you can convert LAMMPS atom dumps into pdb files.
</P>
<P>See the README file in the ch2lmp sub-directory for more information.

<P>The file chain.f creates a LAMMPS data file containing bead-spring
polymer chains and/or monomer solvent atoms.  It uses a text file
containing chain definition parameters as an input.  The created
chains and solvent atoms can strongly overlap, so LAMMPS needs to run
the system initially with a "soft" pair potential to un-overlap it.
The syntax for running the tool is
</P>
<PRE>chain < def.chain > data.file 
</PRE>
<P>See the def.chain or def.chain.ab files in the tools directory for
examples of definition files.  This tool was used to create the
system for the <A HREF = "Section_perf.html">chain benchmark</A>.

</H4>
<P>The file micelle2d.f creates a LAMMPS data file containing short lipid
chains in a monomer solution.  It uses a text file containing lipid
definition parameters as an input.  The created molecules and solvent
atoms can strongly overlap, so LAMMPS needs to run the system
initially with a "soft" pair potential to un-overlap it.  The syntax
for running the tool is
</P>
<PRE>micelle2d < def.micelle2d > data.file 
</PRE>

<P>The reax sub-directory contains stand-alond codes that can
post-process the output of the <A HREF = "fix_reax_bonds.html">fix reax/bonds</A>
command from a LAMMPS simulation using <A HREF = "pair_reax.html">ReaxFF</A>.  See
the README.txt file for more info.
</P>
<P>These tools were written by Aidan Thompson at Sandia.
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "restart"></A>restart2data tool 
</H4>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: LAMMPS now has a <A HREF = "write_data.html">write_data</A> command,
which can create a data file from within an input script.  This means
a two line input script can read a restart file, and write it as a
data file.  When the write_data command is fully functional, the
restart2data tool will be obsolete, and will be retired from the
distribution.
</P>
<P>The file restart2data.cpp converts a binary LAMMPS restart file into
an ASCII data file.  The syntax for running the tool is
</P>
<PRE>restart2data restart-file data-file (input-file) 
</PRE>
<P>Input-file is optional and if specified will contain LAMMPS input
commands for the masses and force field parameters, instead of putting
those in the data-file.  Only a few force field styles currently
support this option.
</P>
<P>This tool must be compiled on a platform that can read the binary file
created by a LAMMPS run, since binary files are not compatible across
all platforms.
</P>
<P>Note that a text data file has less precision than a binary restart
file.  Hence, continuing a run from a converted data file will
typically not conform as closely to a previous run as will restarting
from a binary restart file.
</P>
<P>If a "%" appears in the specified restart-file, the tool expects a set
of multiple files to exist.  See the <A HREF = "restart.html">restart</A> and
<A HREF = "write_restart.html">write_restart</A> commands for info on how such sets
of files are written by LAMMPS, and how the files are named.
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "thermo_extract"></A>thermo_extract tool 
</H4>
<P>The thermo_extract tool reads one of more LAMMPS log files and
extracts a thermodynamic value (e.g. Temp, Press).  It spits out the
time,value as 2 columns of numbers so the tool can be used as a quick
way to plot some quantity of interest.  See the header of the
thermo_extract.c file for the syntax of how to run it and other
details.
</P>
<P>This tool was written by Vikas Varshney at Wright Patterson AFB
(vikas.varshney at gmail.com).
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "vim"></A>vim tool 
</H4>
<P>The files in the tools/vim directory are add-ons to the VIM editor
that allow easier editing of LAMMPS input scripts.  See the README.txt
file for details.
</P>
<P>These files were provided by Gerolf Ziegenhain (gerolf at
ziegenhain.com)
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "xmovie"></A>xmovie tool 
</H4>
<P>The xmovie tool is an X-based visualization package that can read
LAMMPS dump files and animate them.  It is in its own sub-directory
with the tools directory.  You may need to modify its Makefile so that
it can find the appropriate X libraries to link against.
</P>
<P>The syntax for running xmovie is
</P>
<PRE>xmovie <B>options</B> dump.file1 dump.file2 ... 
</PRE>
<P>If you just type "xmovie" you will see a list of options.  Note that
by default, LAMMPS dump files are in scaled coordinates, so you
typically need to use the -scale option with xmovie.  When xmovie runs
it opens a visualization window and a control window.  The control
options are straightforward to use.
</P>
<P>Xmovie was mostly written by Mike Uttormark (U Wisconsin) while he
spent a summer at Sandia.  It displays 2d projections of a 3d domain.
While simple in design, it is an amazingly fast program that can
render large numbers of atoms very quickly.  It's a useful tool for
debugging LAMMPS input and output and making sure your simulation is
doing what you think it should.  The animations on the Examples page
of the <A HREF = "http://lammps.sandia.gov">LAMMPS WWW site</A> were created with xmovie.
</P>
<P>I've lost contact with Mike, so I hope he's comfortable with us
distributing his great tool!
