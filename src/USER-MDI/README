The USRE-MDI package adds an mdi_engine command which enables LAMMPS
to operate as a MolSSI Driver Interface (MDI) engine, responding to
commands from an external MDI driver.

It uses the MDI Library, which is available at
https://github.com/MolSSI-MDI/MDI_Library.  The MDI Library is
developed and maintained by Taylor Barnes (tbarnes1@vt.edu) at the
Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI).

For more information about using MDI with LAMMPS, see the LAMMPS
documentation for the mdi_engine command and the mdi/engine fix.
For general purpose information about MDI, see the MDI Library
documentation:
https://molssi-mdi.github.io/MDI_Library/html/index.html

The MDI Library is required in order to use this package, and can be
built using the Install.py file in lib/mdi.  For example:

python Install.py -m gcc
python Install.py -m icc
