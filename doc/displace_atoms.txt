displace_atoms command :h3

[Syntax:]

displace_atoms group-ID style args keyword value ... :pre

group-ID = ID of group of atoms to displace :ulb,l
style = {move} or {ramp} or {random} or {rotate} :l
  {move} args = delx dely delz
    delx,dely,delz = distance to displace in each dimension (distance units)
  {ramp} args = ddim dlo dhi dim clo chi
    ddim = {x} or {y} or {z}
    dlo,dhi = displacement distance between dlo and dhi (distance units)
    dim = {x} or {y} or {z}
    clo,chi = lower and upper bound of domain to displace (distance units)
  {random} args = dx dy dz seed
    dx,dy,dz = random displacement magnitude in each dimension (distance units)
    seed = random # seed (positive integer)
  {rotate} args = Px Py Pz Rx Ry Rz theta
    Px,Py,Pz = origin point of axis of rotation (distance units)
    Rx,Ry,Rz = axis of rotation vector
    theta = angle of rotation (degrees) :pre

zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended :l
  keyword = {units}
    value = {box} or {lattice} :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

displace_atoms top move 0 -5 0 units box
displace_atoms flow ramp x 0.0 5.0 y 2.0 20.5 :pre

[Description:]

Displace a group of atoms.  This can be used to move atoms a large
distance before beginning a simulation or to randomize atoms initially
on a lattice.  For example, in a shear simulation, an initial strain
can be imposed on the system.  Or two groups of atoms can be brought
into closer proximity.

The {move} style displaces the group of atoms by the specified 3d
distance.

The {ramp} style displaces atoms a variable amount in one dimension
depending on the atom's coordinate in a (possibly) different
dimension.  For example, the second example command displaces atoms in
the x-direction an amount between 0.0 and 5.0 distance units.  Each
atom's displacement depends on the fractional distance its y
coordinate is between 2.0 and 20.5.  Atoms with y-coordinates outside
those bounds will be moved the minimum (0.0) or maximum (5.0) amount.

The {random} style independently moves each atom in the group by a
random displacement, uniformly sampled from a value between -dx and
+dx in the x dimension, and similarly for y and z.  Random numbers are
used in such a way that the displacement of a particular atom is the
same, regardless of how many processors are being used.

The {rotate} style rotates each atom in the group by the angle {theta}
around a rotation axis {R} = (Rx,Ry,Rz) that goes thru a point {P} =
(Px,Py,Pz).  The direction of rotation for the atoms around the
rotation axis is consistent with the right-hand rule: if your
right-hand's thumb points along {R}, then your fingers wrap around the
axis in the direction of positive theta.

Distance units for displacements and the origin point of the {rotate}
style are determined by the setting of {box} or {lattice} for the
{units} keyword.  {Box} means distance units as defined by the
"units"_units.html command - e.g. Angstroms for {real} units.
{Lattice} means distance units are in lattice spacings.  The
"lattice"_lattice.html command must have been previously used to
define the lattice spacing.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Care should be taken not to move atoms on top of other
atoms.  After the move, atoms are remapped into the periodic
simulation box if needed, and any shrink-wrap boundary conditions (see
the "boundary"_boundary.html command) are enforced which may change
the box size.  Other than this effect, this command does not change
the size or shape of the simulation box.  See the
"change_box"_change_box.html command if that effect is desired.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Atoms can be moved arbitrarily long distances by this
command.  If the simulation box is non-periodic and shrink-wrapped
(see the "boundary"_boundary.html command), this can change its size
or shape.  This is not a problem, except that the mapping of
processors to the simulation box is not changed by this command from
its initial 3d configuration; see the "processors"_processors.html
command.  Thus, if the box size/shape changes dramatically, the
mapping of processors to the simulation box may not end up as optimal
as the initial mapping attempted to be.

You cannot rotate around any rotation vector except the z-axis for a
2d simulation.
