# pair style must define stand-alone short-range Coulombics
# must specify mixing explicitly b/c hybrid/overlay
# QM O,H = types 1,2
# MM O,H = types 3,4
# QM O,H atoms do not LJ interact with each other
# only MM O atoms LJ interact with other b/c MM H is zero
# MM/QM O do LJ interact with each other, same as pair of MM O atoms
# MM O and QM H do LJ interact with each other with non-zero H epsilon = 0.044
#   geometric mixing for epsilon, arithmetic for sigma
#   this is to provide stability for QM H atoms

# mixing only for MM-O/QM-O and MM-O/QM-H
