angle_style quartic command :h3
angle_style quartic/omp command :h3

[Syntax:]

angle_style quartic :pre

[Examples:]

angle_style quartic
angle_coeff 1 129.1948 56.8726 -25.9442 -14.2221 :pre

[Description:]

The {quartic} angle style uses the potential

:c,image(Eqs/angle_quartic.jpg)

where theta0 is the equilibrium value of the angle, and K is a
prefactor.  Note that the usual 1/2 factor is included in K.

The following coefficients must be defined for each angle type via the
"angle_coeff"_angle_coeff.html command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the "read_data"_read_data.html
or "read_restart"_read_restart.html commands:

theta0 (degrees)
K2 (energy/radian^2)
K3 (energy/radian^3)
K4 (energy/radian^4) :ul

Theta0 is specified in degrees, but LAMMPS converts it to radians
internally; hence the units of K are in energy/radian^2.

Styles with a {gpu}, {intel}, {kk}, {omp}, or {opt} suffix are
functionally the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.
They have been optimized to run faster, depending on your available
hardware, as discussed on the "Speed packages"_Speed_packages.html doc
page.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and should
produce the same results, except for round-off and precision issues.

These accelerated styles are part of the GPU, USER-INTEL, KOKKOS,
USER-OMP and OPT packages, respectively.  They are only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with those packages.  See the "Build
package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.

You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the "-suffix command-line
switch"_Run_options.html when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can use the
"suffix"_suffix.html command in your input script.

See the "Speed packages"_Speed_packages.html doc page for more
instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.

[Restrictions:]

This angle style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
USER_MISC package.  See the "Build package"_Build_package.html doc
page for more info.
