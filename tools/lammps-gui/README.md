LAMMPS GUI

LAMMPS GUI is essentially a small graphical text editor that is linked
to the LAMMPS library and thus can run LAMMPS using the contents of the
text buffer as input directly without requiring an additional LAMMPS
executable. It can also capture and show the screen output, a line graph
of thermodynamic data and snapshot images in separate windows.

Detailed documentation about installing and using LAMMPS GUI is in
the LAMMPS manual.
