dihedral_style cosine/shift/exp command :h3

[Syntax:]

dihedral_style cosine/shift/exp :pre

[Examples:]

dihedral_style cosine/shift/exp
dihedral_coeff 1 10.0 45.0 2.0 :pre

[Description:]

The {cosine/shift/exp} dihedral style uses the potential

:c,image(Eqs/dihedral_cosine_shift_exp.jpg)

where Umin, theta, and a are defined for each dihedral type.

The potential is bounded between \[-Umin:0\] and the minimum is located
at the angle theta0. The a parameter can be both positive or negative
and is used to control the spring constant at the equilibrium.

The spring constant is given by k=a exp(a) Umin/ \[2 (Exp(a)-1)\].
For a>3 k/Umin = a/2 to better than 5% relative error. For negative
values of the a parameter, the spring constant is essentially zero,
and anharmonic terms takes over. The potential is furthermore well
behaved in the limit a->0, where it has been implemented to linear
order in a for a < 0.001.

The following coefficients must be defined for each dihedral type via
the "dihedral_coeff"_dihedral_coeff.html command as in the example
above, or in the data file or restart files read by the
"read_data"_read_data.html or "read_restart"_read_restart.html
commands:

umin (energy)
theta (angle)
A (real number) :ul

[Restrictions:]

This dihedral style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
"user-misc" package.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info on packages.
