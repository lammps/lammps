Body styles :h3

Classes that define body particles are derived from the Body class.
Body particles can represent complex entities, such as surface meshes
of discrete points, collections of sub-particles, deformable objects,
etc.

See the "Howto body"_Howto_body.html doc page for an overview of using
body particles and the various body styles LAMMPS supports.  New
styles can be created to add new kinds of body particles to LAMMPS.

Body_nparticle.cpp is an example of a body particle that is treated as
a rigid body containing N sub-particles.

Here is a brief description of methods you define in your new derived
class.  See body.h for details.

data_body: process a line from the Bodies section of a data file
noutrow: number of sub-particles output is generated for
noutcol: number of values per-sub-particle output is generated for
output: output values for the Mth sub-particle
pack_comm_body: body attributes to communicate every timestep
unpack_comm_body: unpacking of those attributes
pack_border_body: body attributes to communicate when reneighboring is done
unpack_border_body: unpacking of those attributes :tb(s=:)
