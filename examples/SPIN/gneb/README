Perform geodesic NEB calculations for spin configurations.
The two examples are:
- the magnetic switching of an iron nanoisland
- the collapse of a magnetic skyrmion

Run those examples as:

mpirun -np 3 lmp_mpi -in in.gneb.iron -partition 3x1

You should be able to use any number of replicas >= 3.
