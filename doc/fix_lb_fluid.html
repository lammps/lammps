<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Implement a lattice-Boltzmann fluid on a uniform mesh covering the LAMMPS 
simulation domain.  The MD particles described by <I>group-ID</I> apply a velocity
dependent force to the fluid.
</P>
<P>The lattice-Boltzmann algorithm solves for the fluid motion governed by 
the Navier Stokes equations,
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/fix_lb_fluid_navierstokes.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>with,
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/fix_lb_fluid_viscosity.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>where rho is the fluid density, u is the local fluid velocity, sigma
is the stress tensor, F is a local external force, and eta and Lambda
are the shear and bulk viscosities respectively.  Here, we have
implemented
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/fix_lb_fluid_stress.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>with a_0 set to 1/3 (dx/dt)^2 by default.
</P>
<P>The algorithm involves tracking the time evolution of a set of partial
distribution functions which evolve according to a velocity
discretized version of the Boltzmann equation,
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/fix_lb_fluid_boltzmann.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>where the first term on the right hand side represents a single time
relaxation towards the equilibrium distribution function, and tau is a
parameter physically related to the viscosity.  On a technical note,
we have implemented a 15 velocity model (D3Q15) as default; however,
the user can switch to a 19 velocity model (D3Q19) through the use of
the <I>D3Q19</I> keyword.  This fix provides the user with the choice of
two algorithms to solve this equation, through the specification of
the keyword <I>LBtype</I>.  If <I>LBtype</I> is set equal to 1, the standard
finite difference LB integrator is used.  If <I>LBtype</I> is set equal to
2, the algorithm of <A HREF = "#Ollila">Ollila et al.</A> is used.
</P>
<P>Physical variables are then defined in terms of moments of the distribution
functions,
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/fix_lb_fluid_properties.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>Full details of the lattice-Boltzmann algorithm used can be found in
<A HREF = "#Mackay">Mackay et al.</A>.
</P>
<P>The fluid is coupled to the MD particles described by <I>group-ID</I>
through a velocity dependent force.  The contribution to the fluid
force on a given lattice mesh site j due to MD particle alpha is
calculated as:
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/fix_lb_fluid_fluidforce.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>where v_n is the velocity of the MD particle, u_f is the fluid
velocity interpolated to the particle location, and gamma is the force
coupling constant.  Zeta is a weight assigned to the grid point,
obtained by distributing the particle to the nearest lattice sites.
For this, the user has the choice between a trilinear stencil, which
provides a support of 8 lattice sites, or the immersed boundary method
Peskin stencil, which provides a support of 64 lattice sites.  While
the Peskin stencil is seen to provide more stable results, the
trilinear stencil may be better suited for simulation of objects close
to walls, due to its smaller support.  Therefore, by default, the
Peskin stencil is used; however the user may switch to the trilinear
stencil by specifying the keyword, <I>trilinear</I>.
</P>
<P>By default, the force coupling constant, gamma, is calculated according to
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/fix_lb_fluid_gammadefault.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>Here, m_v is the mass of the MD particle, m_u is a representative
fluid mass at the particle location, and dt_collision is a collision
time, chosen such that tau/dt_collision = 1 (see <A HREF = "#Mackay2">Mackay and
Denniston</A> for full details).  In order to calculate m_u, the
fluid density is interpolated to the MD particle location, and
multiplied by a volume, node_area*dx_lb, where node_area represents
the portion of the surface area of the composite object associated
with a given MD particle.  By default, node_area is set equal to
dx_lb*dx_lb; however specific values for given atom types can be set
using the <I>setArea</I> keyword.
</P>
<P>The user also has the option of specifying their own value for the
force coupling constant, for all the MD particles associated with the
fix, through the use of the <I>setGamma</I> keyword.  This may be useful
when modelling porous particles.  See <A HREF = "#Mackay">Mackay et al.</A> for a
detailed description of the method by which the user can choose an
appropriate gamma value.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: while this fix applies the force of the particles on
the fluid, it does not apply the force of the fluid to the particles.
When the force coupling constant is set using the default method,
there is only one option to include this hydrodynamic force on the
particles, and that is through the use of the
<A HREF = "fix_lb_viscous.html">lb/viscous</A> fix.  This fix adds the hydrodynamic
force to the total force acting on the particles, after which any of
the built-in LAMMPS integrators can be used to integrate the particle
motion.  However, if the user specifies their own value for the force
coupling constant, as mentioned in <A HREF = "#Mackay">Mackay et al.</A>, the
built-in LAMMPS integrators may prove to be unstable.  Therefore, we
have included our own integrators <A HREF = "fix_lb_rigid_pc_sphere.html">fix
lb/rigid/pc/sphere</A>, and <A HREF = "fix_lb_pc.html">fix
lb/pc</A>, to solve for the particle motion in these
cases.  These integrators should not be used with the
<A HREF = "fix_lb_viscous.html">lb/viscous</A> fix, as they add hydrodynamic forces
to the particles directly.  In addition, they can not be used if the
force coupling constant has been set the default way.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: if the force coupling constant is set using the
default method, and the <A HREF = "fix_lb_viscous.html">lb/viscous</A> fix is NOT
used to add the hydrodynamic force to the total force acting on the
particles, this physically corresponds to a situation in which an
infinitely massive particle is moving through the fluid (since
collisions between the particle and the fluid do not act to change the
particle's velocity).  Therefore, the user should set the mass of the
particle to be significantly larger than the mass of the fluid at the
particle location, in order to approximate an infinitely massive
particle (see the dragforce test run for an example).
</P>
<HR>

<P>Inside the fix, parameters are scaled by the lattice-Boltzmann
timestep, dt, grid spacing, dx, and mass unit, dm.  dt is set equal to
(nevery*dt_MD), where dt_MD is the MD timestep.  By default, dm is set
equal to 1.0, and dx is chosen so that tau/(dt) =
(3*eta*dt)/(rho*dx^2) is approximately equal to 1.  However, the user
has the option of specifying their own values for dm, and dx, by using
the optional keywords <I>dm</I>, and <I>dx</I> respectively.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: Care must be taken when choosing both a value for dx,
and a simulation domain size.  This fix uses the same subdivision of
the simulation domain among processors as the main LAMMPS program.  In
order to uniformly cover the simulation domain with lattice sites, the
lengths of the individual LAMMPS subdomains must all be evenly
divisible by dx.  If the simulation domain size is cubic, with equal
lengths in all dimensions, and the default value for dx is used, this
will automatically be satisfied.
</P>
<P>Physical parameters describing the fluid are specified through
<I>viscosity</I>, <I>density</I>, and <I>a0</I>. If the force coupling constant is
set the default way, the surface area associated with the MD particles
is specified using the <I>setArea</I> keyword.  If the user chooses to
specify a value for the force coupling constant, this is set using the
<I>setGamma</I> keyword.  These parameters should all be given in terms of
the mass, distance, and time units chosen for the main LAMMPS run, as
they are scaled by the LB timestep, lattice spacing, and mass unit,
inside the fix.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>setArea</I> keyword allows the user to associate a surface area with
a given atom type.  For example if a spherical composite object of
radius R is represented as a spherical shell of N evenly distributed
MD particles, all of the same type, the surface area per particle
associated with that atom type should be set equal to 4*pi*R^2/N.
This keyword should only be used if the force coupling constant,
gamma, is set the default way.
</P>
<P>The <I>setGamma</I> keyword allows the user to specify their own value for
the force coupling constant, gamma, instead of using the default
value.
</P>
<P>The <I>scaleGamma</I> keyword should be used in conjunction with the
<I>setGamma</I> keyword, when the user wishes to specify different gamma
values for different atom types.  This keyword allows the user to
scale the <I>setGamma</I> gamma value by a factor, gammaFactor, for a given
atom type.
</P>
<P>The <I>dx</I> keyword allows the user to specify a value for the LB grid
spacing.
</P>
<P>The <I>dm</I> keyword allows the user to specify the LB mass unit.
</P>
<P>If the <I>a0</I> keyword is used, the value specified is used for the
square of the speed of sound in the fluid.  If this keyword is not
present, the speed of sound squared is set equal to (1/3)*(dx/dt)^2.
Setting a0 > (dx/dt)^2 is not allowed, as this may lead to
instabilities.
</P>
<P>If the <I>noise</I> keyword is used, followed by a a positive temperature
value, and a positive integer random number seed, a thermal
lattice-Boltzmann algorithm is used.  If <I>LBtype</I> is set equal to 1
(i.e. the standard LB integrator is chosen), the thermal LB algorithm
of <A HREF = "#Adhikari">Adhikari et al.</A> is used; however if <I>LBtype</I> is set
equal to 2 both the LB integrator, and thermal LB algorithm described
in <A HREF = "#Ollila">Ollila et al.</A> are used.
</P>
<P>If the <I>calcforce</I> keyword is used, both the fluid force and torque
acting on the specified particle group are printed to the screen every
N timesteps.
</P>
<P>If the keyword <I>trilinear</I> is used, the trilinear stencil is used to
interpolate the particle nodes onto the fluid mesh.  By default, the
immersed boundary method, Peskin stencil is used.  Both of these
interpolation methods are described in <A HREF = "#Mackay">Mackay et al.</A>.
</P>
<P>If the keyword <I>D3Q19</I> is used, the 19 velocity (D3Q19) lattice is
used by the lattice-Boltzmann algorithm.  By default, the 15 velocity
(D3Q15) lattice is used.
</P>
<P>If the keyword <I>write_restart</I> is used, followed by a positive
integer, N, a binary restart file is printed every N LB timesteps.
This restart file only contains information about the fluid.
Therefore, a LAMMPS restart file should also be written in order to
print out full details of the simulation.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: When a large number of lattice grid points are used,
the restart files may become quite large.
</P>
<P>In order to restart the fluid portion of the simulation, the keyword
<I>read_restart</I> is specified, followed by the name of the binary
lb_fluid restart file to be used.
</P>
<P>If the <I>zwall_velocity</I> keyword is used y-velocities are assigned to
the lower and upper walls.  This keyword requires the presence of
walls in the z-direction.  This is set by assigning fixed boundary
conditions in the z-direction.  If fixed boundary conditions are
present in the z-direction, and this keyword is not used, the walls
are assumed to be stationary.
</P>
<P>If the <I>bodyforce</I> keyword is used, a constant body force is added to
the fluid, defined by it's x, y and z components.
</P>
<P>If the <I>printfluid</I> keyword is used, followed by a positive integer, N, 
the fluid densities and velocities at each lattice site are printed to the
screen every N timesteps.
