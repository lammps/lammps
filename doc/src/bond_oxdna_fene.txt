bond_style oxdna_fene command :h3

[Syntax:]

bond_style oxdna_fene :pre

[Examples:]

bond_style oxdna_fene
bond_coeff * 2.0 0.25 0.7525 :pre

[Description:]

The {oxdna_fene} bond style uses the potential

:c,image(Eqs/bond_oxdna_fene.jpg)

to define a modified finite extensible nonlinear elastic (FENE) potential
"(Ouldridge)"_#oxdna_fene to model the connectivity of the phosphate backbone
in the oxDNA force field for coarse-grained modelling of DNA. 

The following coefficients must be defined for the bond type via the
"bond_coeff"_bond_coeff.html command as given in the above example, or in
the data file or restart files read by the "read_data"_read_data.html
or "read_restart"_read_restart.html commands:

epsilon (energy)
Delta (distance)
r0 (distance) :ul

NOTE: This bond style has to be used together with the corresponding oxDNA pair styles
for excluded volume interaction {oxdna_excv}, stacking {oxdna_stk}, cross-stacking {oxdna_xstk}
and coaxial stacking interaction {oxdna_coaxstk} as well as hydrogen-bonding interaction {oxdna_hbond} (see also documentation of 
"pair_style oxdna_excv"_pair_oxdna_excv.html). The coefficients 
in the above example have to be kept fixed and cannot be changed without reparametrizing the entire model.

Example input and data files can be found in /examples/USER/cgdna/examples/duplex1/ and /duplex2/.
A simple python setup tool which creates single straight or helical DNA strands,
DNA duplexes or arrays of DNA duplexes can be found in /examples/USER/cgdna/util/.
A technical report with more information on the model, the structure of the input file,
the setup tool and the performance of the LAMMPS-implementation of oxDNA
can be found in /examples/USER/cgdna/doc/.

[Restrictions:]

This bond style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
USER-CGDNA package and the MOLECULE and ASPHERE package.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info on packages.
