This package provides the pair_style quip command. This pair style
provides an interface to the QUIP/libAtoms library, which includes a
variety of interatomic potentials, including Gaussian Approximation  
Potential (GAP) models.

See lib/quip/README for more information on how to build LAMMPS
with this package.

See examples/USER/quip for several test examples that run QUIP
potentials.
