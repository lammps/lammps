fix qeq/reax command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID qeq/reax Nevery cutlo cuthi tolerance params :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command
qeq/reax = style name of this fix command 
Nevery = perform QEq every this many steps
cutlo,cuthi = lo and hi cutoff for Taper radius
tolerance = precision to which charges will be equilibrated
params = reax/c or a filename :ul

[Examples:]

fix 1 all qeq/reax 1 0.0 10.0 1.0e-6 reax/c
fix 1 all qeq/reax 1 0.0 10.0 1.0e-6 param.qeq :pre

[Description:]

Perform the charge equilibration (QEq) method as described in "(Rappe
and Goddard)"_#Rappe and formulated in "(Nakano)"_#Nakano.  It is
typically used in conjunction with the ReaxFF force field model as
implemented in the "pair_style reax/c"_pair_reax_c.html command, but
it can be used with any potential in LAMMPS, so long as it defines and
uses charges on each atom.  The "fix qeq/comb"_fix_qeq_comb.html
command should be used to perform charge equliibration with the "COMB
potential"_pair_comb.html.  For more technical details about the
charge equilibration performed by fix qeq/reax, see the
"(Aktulga)"_#Aktulga paper.

The QEq method minimizes the electrostatic energy of the system by
adjusting the partial charge on individual atoms based on interactions
with their neighbors.  It reqires some parameters for each atom type.
If the {params} setting above is the word "reax/c", then these are
extracted from the "pair_style reax/c"_pair_reax_c.html command and
the ReaxFF force field file it reads in.  If a file name is specified
for {params}, then the parameters are taken from the specified file
and the file must contain one line for each atom type.  The latter
form must be used when performing QeQ with a non-ReaxFF potential.
Each line should be formatted as follows:

itype chi eta gamma :pre

where {itype} is the atom type from 1 to Ntypes, {chi} denotes the
electronegativity in eV, {eta} denotes the self-Coulomb
potential in eV, and {gamma} denotes the valence orbital
exponent.  Note that these 3 quantities are also in the ReaxFF
potential file, except that eta is defined here as twice the eta value
in the ReaxFF file. Note that unlike the rest of LAMMPS, the units
of this fix are hard-coded to be A, eV, and electronic charge. 

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.  No global scalar or vector or per-atom
quantities are stored by this fix for access by various "output
commands"_Section_howto.html#howto_15.  No parameter of this fix can
be used with the {start/stop} keywords of the "run"_run.html command.

This fix is invoked during "energy minimization"_minimize.html.

[Restrictions:]

This fix is part of the USER-REAXC package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info.

This fix does not correctly handle interactions
involving multiple periodic images of the same atom. Hence, it should not
be used for periodic cell dimensions less than 10 angstroms.
