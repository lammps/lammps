<h1><span class="section-number">3.2. </span>Submitting new features for inclusion in LAMMPS<a class="headerlink" href="#submitting-new-features-for-inclusion-in-lammps" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>We encourage users to submit new features or modifications for LAMMPS to
<a class="reference external" href="https://lammps.sandia.gov/authors.html">the core developers</a> so they
can be added to the LAMMPS distribution. The preferred way to manage and
coordinate this is via the LAMMPS project on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/lammps/lammps">GitHub</a>.  Please see the <a class="reference internal" href="Howto_github.html"><span class="doc">GitHub
Tutorial</span></a> for a demonstration on how to do that.  An
alternative is to contact the LAMMPS developers or the indicated
developer of a package or feature directly and send in your contribution
via e-mail, but that can add a significant delay on getting your
contribution included, depending on how busy the developer is you
contact, how complex a task it would be to integrate that code, and how
many - if any - changes are required before the code can be included.</p>
<p>For any larger modifications or programming project, you are encouraged
to contact the LAMMPS developers ahead of time, in order to discuss
implementation strategies and coding guidelines, that will make it
easier to integrate your contribution and result in less work for
everybody involved. You are also encouraged to search through the list
of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/lammps/lammps/issues">open issues on GitHub</a>
and submit a new issue for a planned feature, so you would not duplicate
the work of others (and possibly get scooped by them) or have your work
duplicated by others.</p>
<p>For informal communication with (some of) the LAMMPS developers you may
ask to join the <a class="reference external" href="https://lammps.slack.com">LAMMPS developers on Slack</a>.
This slack work space is by invitation only. Thus for access, please
send an e-mail to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">slack&#64;lammps.org</span></code> explaining what part of LAMMPS
you are working on.  Only discussions related to LAMMPS development are
tolerated, so this is <strong>NOT</strong> for people that look for help with compiling,
installing, or using LAMMPS. Please contact the <a class="reference external" href="https://lammps.sandia.gov/mail.html">lammps-users mailing
list</a> for those purposes instead.</p>
<p>How quickly your contribution will be integrated depends largely on how
much effort it will cause to integrate and test it, how much it requires
changes to the core codebase, and of how much interest it is to the
larger LAMMPS community.  Please see below for a checklist of typical
requirements. Once you have prepared everything, see the <a class="reference internal" href="Howto_github.html"><span class="doc">LAMMPS GitHub
Tutorial</span></a> page for instructions on
how to submit your changes or new files through a GitHub pull
request. If you prefer to submit patches or full files, you should first
make certain, that your code works correctly with the latest patch-level
version of LAMMPS and contains all bug fixes from it. Then create a
gzipped tar file of all changed or added files or a corresponding patch
file using ‘diff -u’ or ‘diff -c’ and compress it with gzip. Please only
use gzip compression, as this works well on all platforms.</p>
<p>If the new features/files are broadly useful we may add them as core
files to LAMMPS or as part of a <a class="reference internal" href="Packages_standard.html"><span class="doc">standard package</span></a>.  Else we will add them as a
user-contributed file or <a class="reference internal" href="Packages_user.html"><span class="doc">user package</span></a>.  Examples
of user packages are in src sub-directories that start with USER.  The
USER-MISC package is simply a collection of (mostly) unrelated single
files, which is the simplest way to have your contribution quickly
added to the LAMMPS distribution.  All the standard and user packages
are listed and described on the <a class="reference internal" href="Packages_details.html"><span class="doc">Packages details</span></a> doc page.</p>
<p>Note that by providing us files to release, you are agreeing to make
them open-source, i.e. we can release them under the terms of the GPL,
used as a license for the rest of LAMMPS.  See the <a class="reference internal" href="Intro_opensource.html"><span class="doc">LAMMPS license</span></a> doc page for details.</p>
<p>With user packages and files, all we are really providing (aside from
the fame and fortune that accompanies having your name in the source
code and on the <a class="reference external" href="https://lammps.sandia.gov/authors.html">Authors page</a>
of the <a class="reference external" href="https://lammps.sandia.gov">LAMMPS WWW site</a>), is a means for you to distribute your
work to the LAMMPS user community, and a mechanism for others to
easily try out your new feature.  This may help you find bugs or make
contact with new collaborators.  Note that you’re also implicitly
agreeing to support your code which means answer questions, fix bugs,
and maintain it if LAMMPS changes in some way that breaks it (an
unusual event).</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>If you prefer to actively develop and support your add-on
feature yourself, then you may wish to make it available for download
from your own website, as a user package that LAMMPS users can add to
their copy of LAMMPS.  See the <a class="reference external" href="https://lammps.sandia.gov/offsite.html">Offsite LAMMPS packages and tools</a> page of the LAMMPS web
site for examples of groups that do this.  We are happy to advertise
your package and web site from that page.  Simply email the
<a class="reference external" href="https://lammps.sandia.gov/authors.html">developers</a> with info about
your package and we will post it there.</p>
</div>
<p>The previous sections of this doc page describe how to add new “style”
files of various kinds to LAMMPS.  Packages are simply collections of
one or more new class files which are invoked as a new style within a
LAMMPS input script.  If designed correctly, these additions typically
do not require changes to the main core of LAMMPS; they are simply
add-on files.  If you think your new feature requires non-trivial
changes in core LAMMPS files, you should <a class="reference external" href="https://lammps.sandia.gov/authors.html">communicate with the
developers</a>, since we may or
may not want to include those changes for some reason.  An example of a
trivial change is making a parent-class method “virtual” when you derive
a new child class from it.</p>
<p>Here is a checklist of steps you need to follow to submit a single file
or user package for our consideration.  Following these steps will save
both you and us time. Please have a look at the existing files in
packages in the src directory for examples. If you are uncertain, please ask.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>All source files you provide must compile with the most current
version of LAMMPS with multiple configurations. In particular you
need to test compiling LAMMPS from scratch with -DLAMMPS_BIGBIG
set in addition to the default -DLAMMPS_SMALLBIG setting. Your code
will need to work correctly in serial and in parallel using MPI.</p></li>
<li><p>For consistency with the rest of LAMMPS and especially, if you want
your contribution(s) to be added to main LAMMPS code or one of its
standard packages, it needs to be written in a style compatible with
other LAMMPS source files. This means: 2-character indentation per
level, <strong>no tabs</strong>, no lines over 80 characters. I/O is done via
the C-style stdio library (mixing of stdio and iostreams is generally
discouraged), class header files should not import any system headers
outside of &lt;cstdio&gt;, STL containers should be avoided in headers,
system header from the C library should use the C++-style names
(&lt;cstdlib&gt;, &lt;cstdio&gt;, or &lt;cstring&gt;) instead of the C-style names
&lt;stdlib.h&gt;, &lt;stdio.h&gt;, or &lt;string.h&gt;), and forward declarations
used where possible or needed to avoid including headers.
All added code should be placed into the LAMMPS_NS namespace or a
sub-namespace; global or static variables should be avoided, as they
conflict with the modular nature of LAMMPS and the C++ class structure.
Header files must <strong>not</strong> import namespaces with <em>using</em>.
This all is so the developers can more easily understand, integrate,
and maintain your contribution and reduce conflicts with other parts
of LAMMPS.  This basically means that the code accesses data
structures, performs its operations, and is formatted similar to other
LAMMPS source files, including the use of the error class for error
and warning messages.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want your contribution to be added as a user-contributed
feature, and it’s a single file (actually a *.cpp and *.h file) it can
rapidly be added to the USER-MISC directory.  Send us the one-line
entry to add to the USER-MISC/README file in that dir, along with the
2 source files.  You can do this multiple times if you wish to
contribute several individual features.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want your contribution to be added as a user-contribution and
it is several related features, it is probably best to make it a user
package directory with a name like USER-FOO.  In addition to your new
files, the directory should contain a README text file.  The README
should contain your name and contact information and a brief
description of what your new package does.  If your files depend on
other LAMMPS style files also being installed (e.g. because your file
is a derived class from the other LAMMPS class), then an Install.sh
file is also needed to check for those dependencies.  See other README
and Install.sh files in other USER directories as examples.  Send us a
tarball of this USER-FOO directory.</p></li>
<li><p>Your new source files need to have the LAMMPS copyright, GPL notice,
and your name and email address at the top, like other
user-contributed LAMMPS source files.  They need to create a class
that is inside the LAMMPS namespace.  If the file is for one of the
USER packages, including USER-MISC, then we are not as picky about the
coding style (see above).  I.e. the files do not need to be in the
same stylistic format and syntax as other LAMMPS files, though that
would be nice for developers as well as users who try to read your
code.</p></li>
<li><p>You <strong>must</strong> also create a <strong>documentation</strong> file for each new command
or style you are adding to LAMMPS. For simplicity and convenience, the
documentation of groups of closely related commands or styles may be
combined into a single file.  This will be one file for a single-file
feature.  For a package, it might be several files.  These are text
files with a .rst extension using the <a class="reference external" href="https://docutils.readthedocs.io/en/sphinx-docs/user/rst/quickstart.html">reStructuredText</a>
markup language, that are then converted to HTML and PDF using the
<a class="reference external" href="https://sphinx-doc.org">Sphinx</a> documentation generator tool.  Running Sphinx with
the included configuration requires Python 3.x.  Configuration
settings and custom extensions for this conversion are included in the
source distribution, and missing python packages will be transparently
downloaded into a virtual environment via pip. Thus, if your local
system is missing required packages, you need access to the
internet. The translation can be as simple as doing “make html pdf” in
the doc folder.  As appropriate, the text files can include inline
mathematical expression or figures (see doc/JPG for examples).
Additional PDF files with further details (see doc/PDF for examples)
may also be included.  The doc page should also include literature
citations as appropriate; see the bottom of doc/fix_nh.rst for
examples and the earlier part of the same file for how to format the
cite itself.  Citation labels must be unique across all .rst files.
The “Restrictions” section of the doc page should indicate if your
command is only available if LAMMPS is built with the appropriate
USER-MISC or USER-FOO package.  See other user package doc files for
examples of how to do this.  Please run at least “make html” and “make
spelling” and carefully inspect and proofread the resulting HTML
format doc page before submitting your code.  Upon submission of a
pull request, checks for error free completion of the HTML and PDF
build will be performed and also a spell check, a check for correct
anchors and labels, and a check for completeness of references all
styles in their corresponding tables and lists is run.  In case the
spell check reports false positives they can be added to the file
doc/utils/sphinx-config/false_positives.txt</p></li>
<li><p>For a new package (or even a single command) you should include one or
more example scripts demonstrating its use.  These should run in no
more than a couple minutes, even on a single processor, and not require
large data files as input.  See directories under examples/USER for
examples of input scripts other users provided for their packages.
These example inputs are also required for validating memory accesses
and testing for memory leaks with valgrind</p></li>
<li><p>If there is a paper of yours describing your feature (either the
algorithm/science behind the feature itself, or its initial usage, or
its implementation in LAMMPS), you can add the citation to the *.cpp
source file.  See src/USER-EFF/atom_vec_electron.cpp for an example.
A LaTeX citation is stored in a variable at the top of the file and a
single line of code that references the variable is added to the
constructor of the class.  Whenever a user invokes your feature from
their input script, this will cause LAMMPS to output the citation to a
log.cite file and prompt the user to examine the file.  Note that you
should only use this for a paper you or your group authored.
E.g. adding a cite in the code for a paper by Nose and Hoover if you
write a fix that implements their integrator is not the intended
usage.  That kind of citation should just be in the doc page you
provide.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, as a general rule-of-thumb, the more clear and
self-explanatory you make your documentation and README files, and the
easier you make it for people to get started, e.g. by providing example
scripts, the more likely it is that users will try out your new feature.</p>
