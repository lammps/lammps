pair_style lj/expand command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style lj/expand cutoff :pre

cutoff = global cutoff for lj/expand interactions (distance units) :ul

[Examples:]

pair_style lj/expand 2.5
pair_coeff * * 1.0 1.0 0.5
pair_coeff 1 1 1.0 1.0 -0.2 2.0 :pre

[Description:]

Style {lj/expand} computes a LJ interaction with a distance shifted by
delta which can be useful when particles are of different sizes, since
it is different that using different sigma values in a standard LJ
formula:

:c,image(Eqs/pair_lj_expand.jpg)

Rc is the cutoff which does not include the delta distance.  I.e. the
actual force cutoff is the sum of cutoff + delta.

The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atoms
types via the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command as in the examples
above, or in the data file or restart files read by the
"read_data"_read_data.html or "read_restart"_read_restart.html
commands, or by mixing as described below:

epsilon (energy units)
sigma (distance units)
delta (distance units)
cutoff (distance units) :ul

The delta values can be positive or negative.  The last coefficient is
optional.  If not specified, the global LJ cutoff is used.

[Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, per-atom energy/stress,
restart, rRESPA info]:

For atom type pairs I,J and I != J, the epsilon, sigma, and shift
coefficients and cutoff distance for this pair style can be mixed.
Shift is always mixed via an {arithmetic} rule.  The other
coefficients are mixed according to the pair_modify mix value.  The
default mix value is {geometric}.  See the "pair_modify" command for
details.

This pair style supports the "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html shift
option for the energy of the pair interaction.

The "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html table option is not relevant
for this pair style.

This pair style supports the "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html tail
option for adding a long-range tail correction to the energy and
pressure of the pair interaction.

This pair style can calculate per-atom energy and stress, as used by
the "compute epair/atom"_compute_epair_atom.html, "compute
stress/atom"_compute_stress_atom.html, and "dump custom"_dump.html
commands.

This pair style writes its information to "binary restart
files"_restart.html, so pair_style and pair_coeff commands do not need
to be specified in an input script that reads a restart file.

This pair style can only be used via the {pair} keyword of the
"run_style respa"_run_style.html command.  It does not support the
{inner}, {middle}, {outer} keywords of the "run_style
command"_run_style.html.
