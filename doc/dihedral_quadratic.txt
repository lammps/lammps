dihedral_style quadratic command :h3

[Syntax:]

dihedral_style quadratic :pre

[Examples:]

dihedral_style quadratic
dihedral_coeff 100.0 80.0 :pre

[Description:]

The {quadratic} dihedral style uses the potential:

:c,image(Eqs/dihedral_quadratic.jpg)

This dihedral potential can be used to keep a dihedral in a predefined value.

The following coefficients must be defined for each dihedral type via the
"dihedral_coeff"_dihedral_coeff.html command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the "read_data"_read_data.html
or "read_restart"_read_restart.html commands:

K (energy)
phi0 (degrees)

:line

[Restrictions:]

This angle style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
USER_MISC package.  See the "Making LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 
section for more info on packages.

[Default:] none
