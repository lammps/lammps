kim_style command :h3

[Syntax:]

kim_style mode args :pre

mode = {init model} or {define typeargs}
model = name of the KIM model (KIM potential or KIM simulator model)
typeargs = atom type to species mapping (one entry per atom type) :ul

[Examples:]

kim_style init ex_sim_model_Si_mod_tersoff
kim_style define Si Si
kim_style init LennardJones_Ar
kim_style define Ar :pre

[Description:]

The kim_style command is a high-level wrapper around the
"Knowledge Base for Interatomic Models (OpenKIM)"_https://openkim.org
repository of interatomic potentials, so that they can be used by
LAMMPS scripts.  It does not implement any computations directly, but
rather will generate LAMMPS input commands based on the information
retrieved from the OpenKIM repository.  It is able to realize so-called
"KIM Simulator Models", which are OpenKIM repository entries of models
using native features of the simulation engine in use, i.e. LAMMPS
in this case, but it also supports realizing conventional KIM models
implicitly via generating a "pair_style kim"_pair_kim.html command
followed by a suitable "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command.

The kim_style command has two modes, {init} and {define}, indicated by
the first argument to the kim_style command.  An {init} mode command
must be issued [before] the simulation box is created, while the {define}
mode version may only be used [after] the simulation box exists.  Both
are required.  The {init} mode version sets the model name and may issue
additional commands changing LAMMPS default settings that are required
for using a selected simulator model.  If needed, those settings can be
overridden. The second argument to the {kim_style init} command is the
KIM model ID.

The {kim_style define} command will issue commands that will realize
the selected model (through generating pair_style and pair_coeff commands,
but also other commands, as required).  It has to be issued [after] the
the simulation box is defined. The {kim_style define} command allows a
varying number of additional arguments.  Those are used to map the atom
types in LAMMPS to the available species in the KIM model.  This is
equivalent to the arguments following "pair_coeff * *" in a
"kim"_pair_kim.html pair style. Thus the commands:

kim_style init LennardJones_Ar
kim_style define Ar :pre

will generate the LAMMPS input commands:

pair_style kim LennardJones_Ar
pair_coeff * * Ar :pre

For simulator models, the generated input commands may be more complex
and require that LAMMPS is built with the required packages included.
The commands generated by the kim_style command, can be copied to the
screen or log file, through the "echo"_echo.html command.
The kim_style command will also validate, that a selected simulator
model was generated for the LAMMPS MD code and not some other software.
In addition, the version strings for LAMMPS version used for defining
the simulator model and the LAMMPS version being currently run are
printed, so that it can be tracked down, if there are any incompatible
changes to input script or command syntax between the two LAMMPS versions.

[Restrictions:]

This command is part of the KIM package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  Furthermore, its correct
functioning depends on compiling LAMMPS with all required packages
installed that are required by the commands embedded in any KIM
simulator models used.
See the "Build package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.
