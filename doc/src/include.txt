:line

include command :h3

[Syntax:]

include file :pre

file = filename of new input script to switch to :ul

[Examples:]

include newfile
include in.run2 :pre

[Description:]

This command opens a new input script file and begins reading LAMMPS
commands from that file.  When the new file is finished, the original
file is returned to.  Include files can be nested as deeply as
desired.  If input script A includes script B, and B includes A, then
LAMMPS could run for a long time.

If the filename is a variable (see the "variable"_variable.html
command), different processor partitions can run different input
scripts.

[Restrictions:] none

[Related commands:]

"variable"_variable.html, "jump"_jump.html

[Default:] none
