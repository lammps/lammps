- data.minimal     :  two point opposite charges facing a flat interface
- data.plane       :  two point opposite charges facing a larger flat interface
- data.confined    :  two point opposite charges confined between two interfaces (epsilon1=2/epsilon2=10/epsilon2=2)
- data.sphere      :  two point opposite charges outside a spherical interface (epsilon_in=1/epsilon2=10)
- data.cylinder    :  single point charge facing a cylindrical interface

- in.minimal       :  read in data.minimal
- in.nopbc         :  read in data.* files, using non-periodic boundary conditions, with a large cutoff
                        using "-v data data.foo" from the LAMMPS command line arguments
- in.pbc           :  read in data.* files using periodic boundary conditions 
                        with a slab correction for kspace_style pppm and ewald; not required for msm

For "atom_style  dielectric" the Atoms section in the data file contains 15 following columns:

id mol type q x y z normx normy normz area_per_patch ed em epsilon curvature

where 

id, mol, type, q, x, y and z are similar to those in atom_style full

normx, normy and normz are the three components of the normal unit vector 
of the interface at the patch (vertex).  For real charges (ions), these 3 values 
are irrelevant and can be anything (e.g. 0,0,1).

ed = dielectric difference at the vertex along the normal vector direction.
For example, if (normx,normy,normz) points from medium with epsilon_in to medium with epsilon_out,
then ed = epsilon_out - epsilon_in

em = (epsilon_out + epsilon_in)/2: the mean dielectric value

epsilon = the local epsilon value at the vertex or at the ion.
For real charges, epsilon is the medium dielectric constant, q is the actual real charges.
For interface particles, if q is zero (zero surface charges), epsilon is set to be 1.0;
if q is nonzero (charged surfaces), epsilon is set to be em (the mean dielectric value above).

area_per_patch: surface area of the patch. For real charges, this value is irrelevant, can be 1.0.

curvature: surface curvature at the patch.
For example, for spherical interfaces, curvature = 1/spherical radius.
For planar interfaces, curvature = 0.
