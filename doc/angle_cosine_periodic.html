<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>The <I>cosine/periodic</I> angle style uses the following potential, which
is commonly used in the <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_4">DREIDING</A> force
field, particularly for organometallic systems where <I>n</I> = 4 might be
used for an octahedral complex and <I>n</I> = 3 might be used for a
trigonal center:

<P>where C, B and n are coefficients defined for each angle type.
</P>
<P>See <A HREF = "#Mayo">(Mayo)</A> for a description of the DREIDING force field
</P>
<P>The following coefficients must be defined for each angle type via the
<A HREF = "angle_coeff.html">angle_coeff</A> command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the <A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A>
or <A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A> commands:
</P>
<UL><LI>C (energy)
<LI>B = 1 or -1
<LI>n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 for periodicity 
</UL>
<P>Note that the prefactor C is specified and not the overall force
constant K = C / n^2.  When B = 1, it leads to a minimum for the
linear geometry.  When B = -1, it leads to a maximum for the linear
geometry.

<P>Styles with a <I>cuda</I>, <I>gpu</I>, <I>omp</I>, or <I>opt</I> suffix are functionally
the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.  They have
been optimized to run faster, depending on your available hardware, as
discussed in <A HREF = "Section_accelerate.html">Section_accelerate</A> of the
manual.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and should
produce the same results, except for round-off and precision issues.
</P>
<P>These accelerated styles are part of the USER-CUDA, GPU, USER-OMP and OPT
packages, respectively.  They are only enabled if LAMMPS was built with
those packages.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making LAMMPS</A>
section for more info.
</P>
<P>You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_7">-suffix command-line
switch</A> when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can
use the <A HREF = "suffix.html">suffix</A> command in your input script.
</P>
<P>See <A HREF = "Section_accelerate.html">Section_accelerate</A> of the manual for
more instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.
</P>

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This angle style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
MOLECULAR package (which it is by default).  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info on packages.
