angle_style charmm command :h3

[Syntax:]

angle_style charmm :pre

[Examples:]

angle_style charmm
angle_coeff 1 300.0 107.0 50.0 3.0 :pre

[Description:]

The {charmm} angle style uses the potential

:c,image(Eqs/angle_charmm.jpg)

with an additional Urey_Bradley term based on the distance {r} between
the 1st and 3rd atoms in the angle.  K, theta0, Kub, and Rub are
coefficients defined for each angle type.

See "(MacKerell)"_#MacKerell for a description of the CHARMM force
field.

The following coefficients must be defined for each angle type via the
"angle_coeff"_angle_coeff.html command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the "read_data"_read_data.html
or "read_restart"_read_restart.html commands:

K (energy/radian^2)
theta0 (degrees)
K_ub (energy/distance^2)
r_ub (distance) :ul

Theta0 is specified in degrees, but LAMMPS converts it to radians
internally; hence the units of K are in energy/radian^2.

[Restrictions:] none

[Related commands:]

"angle_coeff"_angle_coeff.html

[Default:] none
