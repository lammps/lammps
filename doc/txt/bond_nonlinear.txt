bond_style nonlinear command :h3
bond_style nonlinear/omp command :h3

[Syntax:]

bond_style nonlinear :pre

[Examples:]

bond_style nonlinear
bond_coeff 2 100.0 1.1 1.4 :pre

[Description:]

The {nonlinear} bond style uses the potential

:c,image(Eqs/bond_nonlinear.jpg)

to define an anharmonic spring "(Rector)"_#Rector of equilibrium
length r0 and maximum extension lamda.

The following coefficients must be defined for each bond type via the
"bond_coeff"_bond_coeff.html command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the "read_data"_read_data.html
or "read_restart"_read_restart.html commands:

epsilon (energy)
r0 (distance)
lamda (distance) :ul

:line

Styles with a {gpu}, {intel}, {kk}, {omp}, or {opt} suffix are
functionally the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.
They have been optimized to run faster, depending on your available
hardware, as discussed on the "Speed packages"_Speed_packages.html doc
page.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and should
produce the same results, except for round-off and precision issues.

These accelerated styles are part of the GPU, USER-INTEL, KOKKOS,
USER-OMP and OPT packages, respectively.  They are only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with those packages.  See the "Build
package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.

You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the "-suffix command-line
switch"_Run_options.html when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can use the
"suffix"_suffix.html command in your input script.

See the "Speed packages"_Speed_packages.html doc page for more
instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.

[Restrictions:]

This bond style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the MOLECULE
package.  See the "Build package"_Build_package.html doc page for more
info.
