[Description:]

The "Open Knowledgebase for Interatomic Models (OpenKIM)"_https://openkim.org
archives interatomic models (IMs) (potentials and force fields) in a format
that can be directly used with LAMMPS using the commands documented on this
page.

Benefits of Using OpenKIM IMs :h4

Employing OpenKIM IMs provides LAMMPS users with multiple benefits:

Reliability :h5

All content archived in OpenKIM is subject to quality control by the "KIM Editor"_https://openkim.org/governance/.
IMs in OpenKIM are archived with full provenance control. Each is associated with a maintainer responsible for the integrity of the content. All changes are tracked and recorded.
IMs in OpenKIM are exhaustively tested using "KIM Tests"_https://openkim.org/getting-started/kim-tests/ that compute a host of material properties, and "KIM Verification Checks"_https://openkim.org/about-verification-checks/ that provide the user with information on various aspects of the IM behavior and coding correctness. This information is displayed on the IM's page on "OpenKIM"_https://openkim.org. :ul

Reproducibility :h5

Each IM in OpenKIM is issued a unique identifier ("KIM ID"_https://openkim.org/about-kim-ids/), which includes a version number (last three digits).  Any changes that can result in different numerical values lead to a version increment in the KIM ID. This makes it possible to reproduce simulations since the specific version of a specific IM used can be retrieved using its KIM ID.
OpenKIM is a member organization of "DataCite"_https://datacite.org/ and issues digitial object identifiers (DOIs) to all IMs archived in OpenKIM. This makes it possible to cite the IM code used in a simulation in a publications to give credit to the developers and further facilitate reproducibility. :ul

Convenience :h5

IMs in OpenKIM are distributed in binary form along with LAMMPS and can be used in a LAMMPS input script simply by providing their KIM ID in the {kim_init} command documented on this page. (For more on using KIM with LAMMPS, see the KIM section of the "Packages details"_Packages_details.html doc page.)
The {kim_query} web query tool provides the ability to use the predictions of IMs for supported material properties (computed via "KIM Tests"https://openkim.org/getting-started/kim-tests/) as part of a LAMMPS input script setup and analysis.
Support is provided for unit conversion between the "units"_units.html system used in the LAMMPS input script and the OpenKIM IM. This makes it possible to use a single input script with IMs using different units without change and minimizes the liklihood of errors due to incompatible units.  :ul

Types of KIM IMs :h4

There are two types of IMs archived in OpenKIM:

The first type is called a {KIM Model}. A KIM Model is an independent computer implemention of an IM written in one of the languages supported by KIM (C, C++, Fortran, Python), which conforms to the KIM Application Programming Interface ("KIM API"_https://openkim.org/kim-api/). A KIM Model will work seamlessly with any simulation code that support the KIM API (including LAMMPS; see "complete list of supported code"_https://openkim.org/projects-using-kim/).
The second type is called a {KIM Simulator Model} (SM). In this case, the IM is implemented natively within the simulation code ({simulator}), i.e. LAMMPS. A separate SM package is archived in OpenKIM for each parameterization of the IM, which includes all of the necessary parameter files, LAMMPS commands, and metadata (supported species, units, etc.) needed to run the IM in LAMMPS. :ol

With these two IM tpes, OpenKIM can archive and test almost all IMs that
can be used by LAMMPS. (It is easy to contribute new IMs to OpenKIM, see
the "upload instructions"_https://openkim.org/getting-started/adding-content/.)

OpenKIM IMs are uniquely identified by a
"KIM ID"_https://openkim.org/about-kim-ids/. The extended KIM ID consists of
a human-readable prefix identifying the type of IM, authors, publication year,
and supported species, separated by two underscores from the KIM ID itself,
which begins with an IM code
({MO} for a KIM Model, and {SM} for a KIM Simulator Model)
followed by a unique 12-digit code and a 3-digit version identifier.
By convension SM prefixes begin with {SM} to readily identify them.

Sim_LAMMPS_ReaxFF_StrachanVanDuinChakraborty_2003_CHNO__SM_107643900657_000 :pre

NOTE: It is also possible to locally install IMs not archived in OpenKIM,
in which case their designation does not have to conform to the KIM ID format.

Using OpenKIM IMs with LAMMPS :h4

Two commands are employed when using OpenKIM IMs, one to select the
IM and perform necessary initializations ({kim_init}), and the second
to set up the IM for use by executing any necessary LAMMPS commands
({kim_interactions}).

OpenKIM IM Initialization :h5

The kim_init command must be located at the top of the input script
before any other commands. Input scripts containing a kim_init command
shoud {not} include a "units"_units.html command or an
"atom_style"_atom_style.html command. These are set by the kim_init
command based on its arguments.

The required arguments of kim_init are the {model} designation of the
IM to be used in the simulation (for an IM archived in OpenKIM this is
its "extended KIM ID"_https://openkim.org/about-kim-ids/), and
the {user_units}, which are the LAMMPS "units"_units.html system used
in the input script.  (Any numerical values in the input script and values
read in from files are expected to be in the {user_units} system.)

Based on the selected model kim_init may modify "atom_style"_atom_style.html.
Some SMs have requirements for this variable. If this is the case, then
atom_style will be set to the required style. Otherwise, the value is left
unchanged (which in the absence of an atom_style command in the input script
is the default LAMMPS value).

Regarding units, the kim_init command behaves in different ways depending
on whether or not "unit conversion mode" is activated as indicated by the
optional {unitarg} argument.
If unit conversion mode is {not} active, then {user_units} must
either match the required units of the IM or the IM must be able
to adjust its units to match. (The latter is only possible with some KIM Models;
SMs can never adjust their units.) If a match is possible, the LAMMPS
"units"_units.html command is called to set the units to
{user_units}. If the match fails, the simulation is terminated with
an error.

If unit conversion mode {is} active, then the LAMMPS "units"_units.html
command is called to set the units to the IM's required or preferred units.
Conversion factors between the IM's units and the {user_units} are
defined for all "physical quantities"_units.html (mass, distance, etc.).
These factors are stored as internal "variables"_variable.html with
standard names:

_u_mass
_u_distance
_u_time
_u_energy
_u_velocity
_u_force
_u_torque
_u_temperature
_u_pressure
_u_viscosity
_u_charge
_u_dipole
_u_efield
_u_density :pre

If desired, the input script can be designed to work with these conversion
factors so that the script will work without change with any OpenKIM IM.
(This approach is used in the
"OpenKIM Testing Framework"_https://openkim.org/getting-started/kim-tests/.)
For example, the following simple script constructs an fcc lattice with
a lattice parameter defined in meters, computes the total energy,
and prints the cohesive energy in Joules regardless of the units of the IM.

kim_init         EAM_Dynamo_ErcolessiAdams_1994_Al__MO_123629422045_005 si unit_conversion_mode
boundary         p p p
lattice          fcc 4.032e-10*$\{_u_distance\}
region           simbox block 0 1 0 1 0 1 units lattice
create_box       1 simbox
create_atoms     1 box
mass             1 4.480134e-26*$\{_u_mass\}
kim_interactions Al
run              0
variable         Ec_in_J equal (pe/count(all))/$\{_u_energy\}
print            "Cohesive Energy = $\{Ec_in_J\} J" :pre

Note the multiplication by $\{_u_distance\} and $\{_u_mass\} to convert
from SI units (specified in the kim_init command) to whatever units the
IM uses (metal in this case), and the division by $\{_u_energy\}
to convert from the IM's energy units to SI units (Joule). This script
will work correctly for any IM for Al (KIM Model or SM) selected by the
kim_init command.

Care must be taken to apply unit conversion to dimensional variables read in
from a file. For example if a configuration of atoms is read in from a
dump file using the "read_dump"_read_dump.html command, the following can
be done to convert the box and all atomic positions to the correct units:

change_box all x scale $\{_u_distance\} y scale $\{_u_distance\} z scale $\{_u_distance\} remap  :pre

NOTE: Unit conversion will only work if the conversion factors are placed in
all appropriate places in the input script. It is up to the user to do this
correctly.

OpenKIM IM Execution :h5

The second and final step in using an OpenKIM IM is to execute the
kim_interaction command. This command must be preceded by a kim_init
command and must follow the "create_box"_create_box.html command,
which defines the number of atom types {N}.
The kim_interaction command has one argument {typeargs}, which contains
a list of {N} chemical species that are mapped to the atom types.

For example, imagine the OpenKIM IM supports Si and C species.
If the LAMMPS simulation has 4 atom types and you want the first three to be Si,
and the fourth to be C, you would use the following kim_interaction command:

kim_interaction Si Si Si C :pre

The kim_interaction command performs all the necessary steps to set up
the OpenKIM IM set in the kim_init command. The specific actions depend
on whether the IM is a KIM Model or a KIM SM.  For a KIM Model,
a "pair_style kim"_pair_kim.html command will be executed followed by
the appropriate pair_coeff command.

For a KIM SM, the set of commands defined in the SM speficiation file
will be executed. For example, consider the ReaxFF SM due to
Strachan et al. (2003) executed by the following commands:

kim_init Sim_LAMMPS_ReaxFF_StrachanVanDuinChakraborty_2003_CHNO__SM_107643900657_000 real
...
...  box specification lines skipped
...
kim_interactions C H N O  :pre

The kim_interactions command executes the following commands defined for this
SM:

pair_style reax/c lmp_control safezone 2.0 mincap 100
pair_coeff * * ffield.reax.rdx C H N O
fix reaxqeq all qeq/reax 1 0.0 10.0 1.0e-6 param.qeq  :pre

Note that the files lmp_control, ffield.reax.rdx and param.qeq are specific
to Strachan et al. (2003) ReaxFF parameterization and are archived as part
of the SM package in OpenKIM. Note also that parameters like cutoff radii
and charge tolerances that have an effect on IM predictions are also
included in the SM definition ensuring reproducibility.

NOTE: Clearly when using using kim_init and kim_interactions to select
and set up an OpenKIM IM, other LAMMPS commands
for the same functions (such as pair_style, pair_coeff, bond_style,
bond_coeff, fixes related to charge equilibration, etc.) should not
appear in the input script.

Using OpenKIM Web Queries in LAMMPS :h4

@@@@@@@@@

The kim_style command is a high-level wrapper around the
"Knowledge Base for Interatomic Models (OpenKIM)"_https://openkim.org
repository of interatomic potentials, so that they can be used by
LAMMPS scripts.  It does not implement any computations directly, but
rather will generate LAMMPS input commands based on the information
retrieved from the OpenKIM repository.  It is able to realize so-called
"KIM Simulator Models", which are OpenKIM repository entries of models
using native features of the simulation engine in use, i.e. LAMMPS
in this case, but it also supports realizing conventional KIM models
implicitly via generating a "pair_style kim"_pair_kim.html command
followed by a suitable "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command.

The kim_style command has two modes, {init} and {define}, indicated by
the first argument to the kim_style command.  An {init} mode command
must be issued [before] the simulation box is created, while the {define}
mode version may only be used [after] the simulation box exists.  Both
are required.  The {init} mode version sets the model name and may issue
additional commands changing LAMMPS default settings that are required
for using a selected simulator model.  If needed, those settings can be
overridden. The second argument to the {kim_style init} command is the
KIM model ID.

In both modes, the keywords {unit_variables} and {unit_from} may be
added.  They control the values of a set of
"internal style variables"_variable.html that can be used to convert
between different unit styles in LAMMPS. The argument to
each keyword is a LAMMPS unit style or NULL, which means to look up
the unit style from what was set with the "units"_units.html command.
Please note, that KIM simulator models will set their preferred unit style.
By default all conversion variables are set to 1.0.  Converting to or
from the "lj" unit style is not supported.  The following variables are defined:

_u_length
_u_mass
_u_time :ul


The {kim_style define} command will issue commands that will realize
the selected model (through generating pair_style and pair_coeff commands,
but also other commands, as required).  It has to be issued [after] the
the simulation box is defined. The {kim_style define} command allows a
varying number of additional arguments.  Those are used to map the atom
types in LAMMPS to the available species in the KIM model.  This is
equivalent to the arguments following "pair_coeff * *" in a
"kim"_pair_kim.html pair style. Thus the commands:

kim_style init LennardJones_Ar
kim_style define Ar :pre

will generate the LAMMPS input commands:

pair_style kim LennardJones_Ar
pair_coeff * * Ar :pre

For simulator models, the generated input commands may be more complex
and require that LAMMPS is built with the required packages included.
The commands generated by the kim_style command, can be copied to the
screen or log file, through the "echo"_echo.html command.
The kim_style command will also validate, that a selected simulator
model was generated for the LAMMPS MD code and not some other software.
In addition, the version strings for LAMMPS version used for defining
the simulator model and the LAMMPS version being currently run are
printed, so that it can be tracked down, if there are any incompatible
changes to input script or command syntax between the two LAMMPS versions.

[Restrictions:]

This command is part of the KIM package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  Furthermore, its correct
functioning depends on compiling LAMMPS with all required packages
installed that are required by the commands embedded in any KIM
simulator models used.
See the "Build package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.
