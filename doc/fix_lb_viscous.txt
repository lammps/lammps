fix lb/viscous command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID lb/viscous :pre
  
ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
lb/viscous = style name of this fix command :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

fix 1 flow lb/viscous 

[Description:]

This fix is similar to the "fix viscous"_fix_viscous.html command, and
is to be used in place of that command when a lattice-Boltzmann fluid
is present, and the user wishes to integrate the particle motion using
one of the built in LAMMPS integrators.

This fix adds a force, F = - Gamma*(velocity-fluid_velocity), to each 
atom, where Gamma is the force coupling constant described in the
"fix lb/fluid"_fix_lb_fluid.html command (which applies an equal and opposite
force to the fluid).  

IMPORTANT NOTE: This fix should only be used in conjunction with one of the
built in LAMMPS integrators; it should not be used with the 
"fix lb/pc"_fix_lb_pc.html or "fix lb/rigid/pc/sphere"_fix_lb_rigid_pc_sphere.html integrators,  
which already include the hydrodynamic forces.  These latter fixes should only be used if the force coupling constant has been set by the user (instead of using the default value); if the default force coupling value is used, then this fix provides the only method for adding the hydrodynamic forces to the particles.

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

As described in the "fix viscous"_fix_viscous.html documentation:

"No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.  None of the "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html options
are relevant to this fix.  No global or per-atom quantities are stored
by this fix for access by various "output
commands"_Section_howto.html#howto_15.  No parameter of this fix can
be used with the {start/stop} keywords of the "run"_run.html command.

The forces due to this fix are imposed during an energy minimization,
invoked by the "minimize"_minimize.html command.  This fix should only
be used with damped dynamics minimizers that allow for
non-conservative forces.  See the "min_style"_min_style.html command
for details."

[Restrictions:]

Can only be used if a lattice-Boltzmann fluid has been created via the
"fix lb/fluid"_fix_lb_fluid.html command, and must come after this command. 

This fix should not be used if either the "fix lb/pc"_fix_lb_pc.html or 
"fix lb/rigid/pc/sphere"_fix_lb_rigid_pc_sphere.html integrator is used. 

 This fix can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
"fluid" package.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#2_3 section for more info on packages.
