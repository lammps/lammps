<UL><LI>ID, group-ID are documented in <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> command
<LI>evaporate = style name of this fix command
<LI>N = delete atoms every this many timesteps

</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Remove M atoms from the simulation every N steps.  This can be used,
for example, to model evaporation of a solvent or drying of a system.
Every N steps, the number of atoms in the fix group and within the
specifed region are counted.  M of these are chosen at random and
deleted.  If there are less than M eligible particles, then all of
them are deleted.
</P>
<P>Note that neighbor lists are re-built on timesteps that atoms are
removed.  Thus you should not remove atoms too frequently or you will
incur overhead due to the cost of building neighbor lists.

<P><B>Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:</B>
</P>
<P>No information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.  None of the <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> options
are relevant to this fix.
</P>
<P>The cummulative number of deleted atoms is stored as a scalar quantity
by this fix.  This quantity can be accessed by various <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#4_15">output
commands</A>.  The scalar value is "intensive",
meaning it is independent of the number of atoms in the simulation.
</P>
<P>No parameter of this fix can be used with the <I>start/stop</I> keywords of
the <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command.  This fix is not invoked during <A HREF = "minimize.html">energy
minimization</A>.
