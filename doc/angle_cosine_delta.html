<P>The <I>cosine/delta</I> angle style uses the potential

<P>where theta0 is the equilibrium value of the angle, and K is a
prefactor.  Note that the usual 1/2 factor is included in K.
</P>
<P>The following coefficients must be defined for each angle type via the
<A HREF = "angle_coeff.html">angle_coeff</A> command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the <A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A>
or <A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A> commands:

<UL><LI>K (energy)
<LI>theta0 (degrees) 
</UL>
<P>Theta0 is specified in degrees, but LAMMPS converts it to radians
internally.

<P>Styles with a <I>cuda</I>, <I>gpu</I>, <I>intel</I>, <I>kk</I>, <I>omp</I>, or <I>opt</I> suffix are
functionally the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.
They have been optimized to run faster, depending on your available
hardware, as discussed in <A HREF = "Section_accelerate.html">Section_accelerate</A>
of the manual.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and
should produce the same results, except for round-off and precision
issues.
</P>
<P>These accelerated styles are part of the USER-CUDA, GPU, USER-INTEL,
KOKKOS, USER-OMP and OPT packages, respectively.  They are only
enabled if LAMMPS was built with those packages.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info.
</P>
<P>You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_7">-suffix command-line
switch</A> when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can
use the <A HREF = "suffix.html">suffix</A> command in your input script.
</P>
<P>See <A HREF = "Section_accelerate.html">Section_accelerate</A> of the manual for
more instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This angle style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
MOLECULAR package (which it is by default).  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info on packages.
