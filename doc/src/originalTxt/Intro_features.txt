A handful of pre- and post-processing tools are packaged with LAMMPS,
some of which can convert input and output files to/from formats used
by other codes; see the "Toos"_Tools.html doc page. :ulb,l

Our group has also written and released a separate toolkit called
"Pizza.py"_pizza which provides tools for doing setup, analysis,
plotting, and visualization for LAMMPS simulations.  Pizza.py is
written in "Python"_python and is available for download from "the
Pizza.py WWW site"_pizza. :l,ule
