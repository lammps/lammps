compute command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID style args :pre

ID = user-assigned name for the computation
group-ID = ID of the group of atoms to perform the computation on
style = one of a list of possible style names (see below)
args = arguments used by a particular style :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 all temp
compute newtemp flow temp/partial 1 1 0
compute 3 all ke/atom :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that will be performed on a group of atoms.
Quantities calculated by a compute are instantaneous values, meaning
they are calculated from information about atoms on the current
timestep or iteration, though a compute may internally store some
information about a previous state of the system.  Defining a compute
does not perform a computation.  Instead computes are invoked by other
LAMMPS commands as needed, e.g. to calculate a temperature needed for
a thermostat fix or to generate thermodynamic or dump file output.
See the "Howto output"_Howto_output.html doc page for a summary of
various LAMMPS output options, many of which involve computes.

The ID of a compute can only contain alphanumeric characters and
underscores.

Computes calculate one of three styles of quantities: global,
per-atom, or local.  A global quantity is one or more system-wide
values, e.g. the temperature of the system.  A per-atom quantity is
one or more values per atom, e.g. the kinetic energy of each atom.
Per-atom values are set to 0.0 for atoms not in the specified compute
group.  Local quantities are calculated by each processor based on the
atoms it owns, but there may be zero or more per atom, e.g. a list of
bond distances.  Computes that produce per-atom quantities have the
word "atom" in their style, e.g. {ke/atom}.  Computes that produce
local quantities have the word "local" in their style,
e.g. {bond/local}.  Styles with neither "atom" or "local" in their
style produce global quantities.

Note that a single compute can produce either global or per-atom or
local quantities, but not both global and per-atom.  It can produce
local quantities in tandem with global or per-atom quantities.  The
compute doc page will explain.

Global, per-atom, and local quantities each come in three kinds: a
single scalar value, a vector of values, or a 2d array of values.  The
doc page for each compute describes the style and kind of values it
produces, e.g. a per-atom vector.  Some computes produce more than one
kind of a single style, e.g. a global scalar and a global vector.

When a compute quantity is accessed, as in many of the output commands
discussed below, it can be referenced via the following bracket
notation, where ID is the ID of the compute:

c_ID | entire scalar, vector, or array
c_ID\[I\] | one element of vector, one column of array
c_ID\[I\]\[J\] | one element of array :tb(s=|)

In other words, using one bracket reduces the dimension of the
quantity once (vector -> scalar, array -> vector).  Using two brackets
reduces the dimension twice (array -> scalar).  Thus a command that
uses scalar compute values as input can also process elements of a
vector or array.

Note that commands and "variables"_variable.html which use compute
quantities typically do not allow for all kinds, e.g. a command may
require a vector of values, not a scalar.  This means there is no
ambiguity about referring to a compute quantity as c_ID even if it
produces, for example, both a scalar and vector.  The doc pages for
various commands explain the details.

In LAMMPS, the values generated by a compute can be used in several
ways:

The results of computes that calculate a global temperature or
pressure can be used by fixes that do thermostatting or barostatting
or when atom velocities are created. :ulb,l

Global values can be output via the "thermo_style
custom"_thermo_style.html or "fix ave/time"_fix_ave_time.html command.
Or the values can be referenced in a "variable equal"_variable.html or
"variable atom"_variable.html command. :l

Per-atom values can be output via the "dump custom"_dump.html command.
Or they can be time-averaged via the "fix ave/atom"_fix_ave_atom.html
command or reduced by the "compute reduce"_compute_reduce.html
command.  Or the per-atom values can be referenced in an "atom-style
variable"_variable.html. :l

Local values can be reduced by the "compute
reduce"_compute_reduce.html command, or histogrammed by the "fix
ave/histo"_fix_ave_histo.html command, or output by the "dump
local"_dump.html command. :l
:ule

The results of computes that calculate global quantities can be either
"intensive" or "extensive" values.  Intensive means the value is
independent of the number of atoms in the simulation,
e.g. temperature.  Extensive means the value scales with the number of
atoms in the simulation, e.g. total rotational kinetic energy.
"Thermodynamic output"_thermo_style.html will normalize extensive
values by the number of atoms in the system, depending on the
"thermo_modify norm" setting.  It will not normalize intensive values.
If a compute value is accessed in another way, e.g. by a
"variable"_variable.html, you may want to know whether it is an
intensive or extensive value.  See the doc page for individual
computes for further info.

:line

LAMMPS creates its own computes internally for thermodynamic output.
Three computes are always created, named "thermo_temp",
"thermo_press", and "thermo_pe", as if these commands had been invoked
in the input script:

compute thermo_temp all temp
compute thermo_press all pressure thermo_temp
compute thermo_pe all pe :pre

Additional computes for other quantities are created if the thermo
style requires it.  See the documentation for the
"thermo_style"_thermo_style.html command.

Fixes that calculate temperature or pressure, i.e. for thermostatting
or barostatting, may also create computes.  These are discussed in the
documentation for specific "fix"_fix.html commands.

In all these cases, the default computes LAMMPS creates can be
replaced by computes defined by the user in the input script, as
described by the "thermo_modify"_thermo_modify.html and "fix
modify"_fix_modify.html commands.

Properties of either a default or user-defined compute can be modified
via the "compute_modify"_compute_modify.html command.

Computes can be deleted with the "uncompute"_uncompute.html command.

Code for new computes can be added to LAMMPS; see the
"Modify"_Modify.html doc page for details.  The results of their
calculations accessed in the various ways described above.

Each compute style has its own doc page which describes its arguments
and what it does.  Here is an alphabetic list of compute styles
available in LAMMPS.  They are also listed in more compact form on the
"Commands compute"_Commands_compute.html doc page.

There are also additional accelerated compute styles included in the
LAMMPS distribution for faster performance on CPUs, GPUs, and KNLs.
The individual style names on the "Commands
compute"_Commands_compute.html doc page are followed by one or more of
(g,i,k,o,t) to indicate which accelerated styles exist.
