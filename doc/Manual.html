</H4></CENTER>
<H4>Version info: 
</H4>
<P>The LAMMPS "version" is the date when it was released, such as 1 May
2010. LAMMPS is updated continuously.  Whenever we fix a bug or add a
feature, we release it immediately, and post a notice on <A HREF = "http://lammps.sandia.gov/bug.html">this page of
the WWW site</A>.  Each dated copy of LAMMPS contains all the
features and bug-fixes up to and including that version date. The
version date is printed to the screen and logfile every time you run
LAMMPS. It is also in the file src/version.h and in the LAMMPS
directory name created when you unpack a tarball, and at the top of
the first page of the manual (this page).
</P>
<P>LAMMPS-ICMS is an experimental variant of LAMMPS with additional
features made available for testing before they will be submitted
for inclusion into the official LAMMPS tree. The source code is 
based on the official LAMMPS svn repository mirror at the Institute
for Computational Molecular Science at Temple University and generally
kept up-to-date as much as possible. Sometimes, e.g. when additional
development work is needed to adapt the upstream changes into
LAMMPS-ICMS it can take longer until synchronization; and occasionally,
e.g. in case of the rewrite of the multi-threading support, the
development will be halted except for important bugfixes until
all features of LAMMPS-ICMS fully compatible with the upstream
version or replaced by alternate implementations.
</P>
<UL><LI>If you browse the HTML doc pages on the LAMMPS WWW site, they always
describe the most current version of upstream LAMMPS, but may be
missing some new features in LAMMPS-ICMS. 

<LI>If you browse the HTML doc pages included in your tarball, they
describe the version you have, however, not all new features in
LAMMPS-ICMS are documented immediately. 

<LI>The <A HREF = "Manual.pdf">PDF file</A> on the WWW site or in the tarball is updated
about once per month.  This is because it is large, and we don't want
it to be part of every patch. 

<LI>There is also a <A HREF = "Developer.pdf">Developer.pdf</A> file in the doc
directory, which describes the internal structure and algorithms of
LAMMPS.  
</UL>
<P>LAMMPS stands for Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel
Simulator.
</P>
<P>LAMMPS is a classical molecular dynamics simulation code designed to
run efficiently on parallel computers.  It was developed at Sandia
National Laboratories, a US Department of Energy facility, with
funding from the DOE.  It is an open-source code, distributed freely
under the terms of the GNU Public License (GPL).
</P>
<P>The primary developers of LAMMPS are <A HREF = "http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp">Steve Plimpton</A>, Aidan
Thompson, and Paul Crozier who can be contacted at
sjplimp,athomps,pscrozi at sandia.gov.  The <A HREF = "http://lammps.sandia.gov">LAMMPS WWW Site</A> at
http://lammps.sandia.gov has more information about the code and its
uses.

<HR>

<P>The LAMMPS documentation is organized into the following sections.  If
you find errors or omissions in this manual or have suggestions for
useful information to add, please send an email to the developers so
we can improve the LAMMPS documentation.
</P>
<P>Once you are familiar with LAMMPS, you may want to bookmark <A HREF = "Section_commands.html#comm">this
page</A> at Section_commands.html#comm since
it gives quick access to documentation for all LAMMPS commands.
