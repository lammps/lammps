origin command :h3

[Syntax:]

origin x y z :pre

x,y,z = origin of a lattice :ul

[Examples:]

origin 0.0 0.5 0.5 :pre

[Description:]

Set the origin of the lattice defined by the "lattice"_lattice.html
command.  The lattice is used by the "create_atoms"_create_atoms.html
command to create new atoms and by other commands that use a lattice
spacing as a distance measure.  This command offsets the origin of the
lattice from the (0,0,0) coordinate of the simulation box by some
fraction of a lattice spacing in each dimension.

The specified values are in lattice coordinates from 0.0 to 1.0, so
that a value of 0.5 means the lattice is displaced 1/2 a cubic cell.

[Restrictions:] none
