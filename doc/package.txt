package command :h3

[Syntax:]

package style args :pre

style = {gpu} or {cuda} or {omp} :ulb,l
args = arguments specific to the style :l
  {gpu} args = mode first last split
    mode = force or force/neigh :l
    first = ID of first GPU to be used on each node :l
    last = ID of last GPU to be used on each node :l
    split = fraction of particles assigned to the GPU :l
  {cuda} args = to be determined
  {omp} args = Nthreads :pre
    Nthreads = # of OpenMP threads to associate with each MPI process :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

package gpu force 0 0 1.0
package gpu force 0 0 0.75
package gpu force/neigh 0 0 1.0
package gpu force/neigh 0 1 -1.0
package cuda blah
package omp 4 :pre

[Description:]

This command invokes package-specific settings.  Currently the
following packages use it: GPU, USER-CUDA, and USER-OMP.

See "this section"_doc/Section_accerate.html of the manual for more
details about using these various packages for accelerating
a LAMMPS calculation.

:line

The {gpu} style invokes options associated with the use of the GPU
package.  It allows you to select and initialize GPUs to be used for
acceleration via this package and configure how the GPU acceleration
is performed.  These settings are required in order to use any style
with GPU acceleration.

The {mode} setting specifies where neighbor list calculations will be
performed.  If {mode} is force, neighbor list calculation is performed
on the CPU. If {mode} is force/neigh, neighbor list calculation is
performed on the GPU. GPU neighbor list calculation currently cannot
be used with a triclinic box. GPU neighbor list calculation currently
cannot be used with "hybrid"_pair_hybrid.html pair styles.  GPU
neighbor lists are not compatible with styles that are not
GPU-enabled.  When a non-GPU enabled style requires a neighbor list,
it will also be built using CPU routines. In these cases, it will
typically be more efficient to only use CPU neighbor list builds.

The {first} and {last} settings specify the GPUs that will be used for
simulation.  On each node, the GPU IDs in the inclusive range from
{first} to {last} will be used.

The {split} setting can be used for load balancing force calculation
work between CPU and GPU cores in GPU-enabled pair styles. If 0 <
{split} < 1.0, a fixed fraction of particles is offloaded to the GPU
while force calculation for the other particles occurs simulataneously
on the CPU. If {split}<0, the optimal fraction (based on CPU and GPU
timings) is calculated every 25 timesteps. If {split} = 1.0, all force
calculations for GPU accelerated pair styles are performed on the
GPU. In this case, "hybrid"_pair_hybrid.html, "bond"_bond_style.html,
"angle"_angle_style.html, "dihedral"_dihedral_style.html,
"improper"_improper_style.html, and "long-range"_kspace_style.html
calculations can be performed on the CPU while the GPU is performing
force calculations for the GPU-enabled pair style.  If all CPU force
computations complete before the GPU, LAMMPS will block until the GPU
has finished before continuing the timestep.

As an example, if you have two GPUs per node and 8 CPU cores per node,
and would like to run on 4 nodes (32 cores) with dynamic balancing of
force calculation across CPU and GPU cores, you could specify

package gpu force/neigh 0 1 -1 :pre

In this case, all CPU cores and GPU devices on the nodes would be
utilized.  Each GPU device would be shared by 4 CPU cores. The CPU
cores would perform force calculations for some fraction of the
particles at the same time the GPUs performed force calculation for
the other particles.

:line

The {cuda} style invokes options associated with the use of the
USER-CUDA package.  These need to be documented.

:line

The {omp} style invokes options associated with the use of the
USER-OMP package.

The only setting to make is the number of OpenMP threads to be
allocated for each MPI process.  For example, if your system has nodes
with dual quad-core processors, it has a total of 8 cores per node.
You could run MPI on 2 cores on each node (e.g. using options for the
mpirun command), and set the {Nthreads} setting to 4.  This would
effectively use all 8 cores on each node.  Since each MPI process
would spawn 4 threads (one of which runs as part of the MPI process
itself).

For performance reasons, you should not set {Nthreads} to more threads
than there are physical cores, but LAMMPS does not check for this.

[Restrictions:]

This command cannot be used after the simulation box is defined by a
"read_data"_read_data.html or "create_box"_create_box.html command.

The cuda style of this command can only be invoked if LAMMPS was built
with the USER-CUDA package.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#2_3 section for more info.

The gpu style of this command can only be invoked if LAMMPS was built
with the GPU package.  See the "Making LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#2_3
section for more info.

The omp style of this command can only be invoked if LAMMPS was built
with the USER-OMP package.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#2_3 section for more info.
