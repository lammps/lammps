fix adapt command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID adapt N keyword values ... :pre
ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
adapt = style name of this fix command :l
N = adapt simulation settings every this many timesteps :l
one or more keyword/value pairs may be appended :l
keyword = {pair} or {atom} :l
  {pair} args = pstyle param I J variable
    pstyle = pair style name, e.g. lj/cut
    pparam = parameter to adapt over time
    I,J = type pair(s) to set parameter for
    pvariable = name of variable that calculates value of parameter
  {atom} args = param variable
    aparam = parameter to adapt over time
    avariable = name of variable that calculates value of parameter :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

fix 1 all adapt 1 pair soft a 1 1 prefactor
fix 1 all adapt 1 pair soft a 2* 3 prefactor
fix 1 all adapt 1 pair soft a * * prefactor soft a 3 3 prefactor2
fix 1 all adapt 10 atom diameter size :pre

[Description:]

Change or adapt one or more specific simulation settings over time as
a simulation runs.  Pair potential and atom attribute parameters which
can be varied by this fix are discussed below.  Many other fixes can
also be used to time-vary simulation parameters, e.g. the "fix deform"
command will change the simulation box size/shape and the "fix move"
command will change atom positions and velocities in prescribed
manners.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Any settings changed by fix adapt are not reset to
their original values at the end of a simulation.  They remain changed
to the final values they were set to at the end of the run.

The {pair} keyword enables various parameters of potentials defined by
the "pair_style"_pair_style.html command to be changed, if the pair
style supports it.  The {pstyle} argument is the name of the pair
style.  If "pair_style hybrid or hybrid/overlay"_pair_hybrid.html is
used, {pstyle} should be a sub-style name.  For example, {pstyle}
could be specified as "soft" or "lubricate".  The {pparam} argument is
the name of the parameter to change.  This is the current list of pair
styles and parameters that can be varied by this fix.  See the doc
pages for individual pair styles for the meaning of these parameters.

"soft"_pair_soft.html, a, global,
"lubricate"_pair_lubricate.html, mu, type pairs :tb(c=3)

Some parameters are global settings for the pair style, e.g. the
viscosity setting "mu" for "pair_style lubricate"_pair_lubricate.html.
Other parameters apply to pairs of atom types within the pair style,
e.g. the prefactor "a" for "pair_style soft"_pair_soft.html.  If a
type pair parameter is specified, the {I} and {J} settings should be
specified to indicate which pair(s) to apply it to.  Note that in all
cases, the "pair_style"_pair_style.html and
"pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html commands must be used in the usual manner
to specify these parameters; the fix adapt command simply overrides
the parameters.

Similar to the "pair_coeff command"_pair_coeff.html, I and J can be
specified in one of two ways.  Explicit numeric values can be used for
each, as in the 1st example above.  I <= J is required.  LAMMPS sets
the coefficients for the symmetric J,I interaction to the same values.

A wild-card asterisk can be used in place of or in conjunction with
the I,J arguments to set the coefficients for multiple pairs of atom
types.  This takes the form "*" or "*n" or "n*" or "m*n".  If N = the
number of atom types, then an asterisk with no numeric values means
all types from 1 to N.  A leading asterisk means all types from 1 to n
(inclusive).  A trailing asterisk means all types from n to N
(inclusive).  A middle asterisk means all types from m to n
(inclusive).  Note that only type pairs with I <= J are considered; if
asterisks imply type pairs where J < I, they are ignored.

If a global parameter is specified, the {I} and {J} settings still
need to be specified, but are ignored.

The {pvariable} argument is the name of an equal-style
"variable"_variable.html which will be evaluated each time this fix is
invoked to set the parameter to a new value.  Equal-style variables
can specify formulas with various mathematical functions, and include
"thermo_style"_thermo_style.html command keywords for the simulation
box parameters and timestep and elapsed time.  Thus it is easy to
specify parameters that change as a function of time or span
consecutive runs in a continuous fashion.  For the latter, see the
{start} and {stop} keywords of the "run"_run.html command and the
{elaplong} keyword of "thermo_style custom"_thermo_style.html for
details.

For example, these commands would change the prefactor coefficient of
the "pair_style soft"_pair_soft.html potential from 10.0 to 30.0 in a
linear fashion over the course of a 1000-step simulation:

variable min equal 10.0
variable max equal 30.0
variable prefactor equal min+(max-min)*elapsed/1000
fix 1 all adapt 1 pair soft a * * prefactor :pre

The {atom} keyword enables various atom properties to be changed.  The
{aparam} argument is the name of the parameter to change.  This is the
current list of atom parameters that can be varied by this fix:

diameter = diameter of particle :ul

The {avariable} argument is the name of an equal-style
"variable"_variable.html which will be evaluated each time this fix is
invoked to set the parameter to a new value.  See the discussion above
describing the formulas associated with equal-style variables.  The
new value is assigned to the corresponding attribute for all atoms in
the fix group.

For example, these commands would shrink the diameter of all granular
particles in the "center" group from 1.0 to 0.1 in a linear fashion
over the course of a 1000-step simulation:

variable start equal 1.0
variable stop equal 0.1
variable size equal start+(stop-start)*elapsed/1000
fix 1 center adapt 10 atom diameter size :pre

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.  None of the "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html options
are relevant to this fix.  No global or per-atom quantities are stored
by this fix for access by various "output
commands"_Section_howto.html#4_15.  No parameter of this fix can be
used with the {start/stop} keywords of the "run"_run.html command.
This fix is not invoked during "energy minimization"_minimize.html.
