[Syntax:]

pair_style style args :pre

style = {born} or {born/coul/long} or {born/coul/msm} or {born/coul/wolf}
args = list of arguments for a particular style :ul
  {born} args = cutoff
    cutoff = global cutoff for non-Coulombic interactions (distance units)
  {born/coul/long} args = cutoff (cutoff2)
    cutoff = global cutoff for non-Coulombic (and Coulombic if only 1 arg) (distance units)
    cutoff2 = global cutoff for Coulombic (optional) (distance units)
  {born/coul/msm} args = cutoff (cutoff2)
    cutoff = global cutoff for non-Coulombic (and Coulombic if only 1 arg) (distance units)
    cutoff2 = global cutoff for Coulombic (optional) (distance units)
  {born/coul/wolf} args = alpha cutoff (cutoff2)
    alpha = damping parameter (inverse distance units)
    cutoff = global cutoff for non-Coulombic (and Coulombic if only 1 arg) (distance units)
    cutoff2 = global cutoff for Coulombic (optional) (distance units) :pre

[Description:]

The {born} style computes the Born-Mayer-Huggins or Tosi/Fumi
potential described in "(Fumi and Tosi)"_#FumiTosi, given by

:c,image(Eqs/pair_born.jpg)

where sigma is an interaction-dependent length parameter, rho is an
ionic-pair dependent length parameter, and Rc is the cutoff.

The styles with {coul/long} or {coul/msm} add a Coulombic term as
described for the "lj/cut"_pair_lj.html pair styles.  An additional
damping factor is applied to the Coulombic term so it can be used in
conjunction with the "kspace_style"_kspace_style.html command and its
{ewald} or {pppm} of {msm} option.  The Coulombic cutoff specified for
this style means that pairwise interactions within this distance are
computed directly; interactions outside that distance are computed in
reciprocal space.

If one cutoff is specified for the {born/coul/long} and
{born/coul/msm} style, it is used for both the A,C,D and Coulombic
terms.  If two cutoffs are specified, the first is used as the cutoff
for the A,C,D terms, and the second is the cutoff for the Coulombic
term.

The {born/coul/wolf} style adds a Coulombic term as described for the
Wolf potential in the "coul/wolf"_pair_coul.html pair style.

Note that these potentials are related to the "Buckingham
potential"_pair_born.html.

The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atoms
types via the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command as in the examples
above, or in the data file or restart files read by the
"read_data"_read_data.html or "read_restart"_read_restart.html
commands, or by mixing as described below:

A (energy units)
rho (distance units)
sigma (distance units)
C (energy units * distance units^6)
D (energy units * distance units^8)
cutoff (distance units) :ul

The second coefficient, rho, must be greater than zero.

The last coefficient is optional.  If not specified, the global A,C,D
cutoff specified in the pair_style command is used.

For {born/coul/long} and {born/coul/wolf} no Coulombic cutoff can be
specified for an individual I,J type pair.  All type pairs use the
same global Coulombic cutoff specified in the pair_style command.

Styles with a {cuda}, {gpu}, {intel}, {kk}, {omp}, or {opt} suffix are
functionally the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.
They have been optimized to run faster, depending on your available
hardware, as discussed in "Section_accelerate"_Section_accelerate.html
of the manual.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and
should produce the same results, except for round-off and precision
issues.

These accelerated styles are part of the USER-CUDA, GPU, USER-INTEL,
KOKKOS, USER-OMP and OPT packages, respectively.  They are only
enabled if LAMMPS was built with those packages.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info.

You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the "-suffix command-line
switch"_Section_start.html#start_7 when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can
use the "suffix"_suffix.html command in your input script.

See "Section_accelerate"_Section_accelerate.html of the manual for
more instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.

[Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info]:

These pair styles do not support mixing.  Thus, coefficients for all
I,J pairs must be specified explicitly.

These styles support the "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html shift option
for the energy of the exp(), 1/r^6, and 1/r^8 portion of the pair
interaction.

The {born/coul/long} pair style supports the
"pair_modify"_pair_modify.html table option ti tabulate the
short-range portion of the long-range Coulombic interaction.

These styles support the pair_modify tail option for adding long-range
tail corrections to energy and pressure.

Thess styles writes thei information to binary "restart"_restart.html
files, so pair_style and pair_coeff commands do not need to be
specified in an input script that reads a restart file.

These styles can only be used via the {pair} keyword of the "run_style
respa"_run_style.html command.  They do not support the {inner},
{middle}, {outer} keywords.

[Restrictions:]

The {born/coul/long} style is part of the KSPACE package.  It is only
enabled if LAMMPS was built with that package (which it is by
default).  See the "Making LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section
for more info.

[Default:] none
