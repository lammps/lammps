dihedral_style fourier command :h3
dihedral_style fourier/omp command :h3

[Syntax:]

dihedral_style fourier :pre

[Examples:]

dihedral_style fourier
dihedral_coeff 1 3 -0.846200 3 0.0 7.578800 1 0 0.138000 2 -180.0 :pre

[Description:]

The {fourier} dihedral style uses the potential:

:c,image(Eqs/dihedral_fourier.jpg)

The following coefficients must be defined for each dihedral type via the
"dihedral_coeff"_dihedral_coeff.html command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the "read_data"_read_data.html
or "read_restart"_read_restart.html commands:

m (integer >=1)
K1 (energy)
n1 (integer >= 0)
d1 (degrees)
....
Km (energy)
nm (integer >= 0)
dm (degrees) :ul

Styles with a {cuda}, {gpu}, {omp}, or {opt} suffix are functionally
the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.  They have
been optimized to run faster, depending on your available hardware, as
discussed in "Section_accelerate"_Section_accelerate.html of the
manual.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and should
produce the same results, except for round-off and precision issues.

These accelerated styles are part of the USER-CUDA, GPU, USER-OMP and OPT
packages, respectively.  They are only enabled if LAMMPS was built with
those packages.  See the "Making LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3
section for more info.

You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the "-suffix command-line
switch"_Section_start.html#start_7 when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can
use the "suffix"_suffix.html command in your input script.

See "Section_accelerate"_Section_accelerate.html of the manual for
more instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.

[Restrictions:]

This angle style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
USER_MISC package.  See the "Making LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 
section for more info on packages.
