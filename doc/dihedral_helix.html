<P>This coarse-grain dihedral potential is described in <A HREF = "#Guo">(Guo)</A>.
For dihedral angles in the helical region, the energy function is
represented by a standard potential consisting of three minima, one
corresponding to the trans (t) state and the other to gauche states
(g+ and g-).  The paper describes how the A,B,C parameters are chosen
so as to balance secondary (largely driven by local interactions) and
tertiary structure (driven by long-range interactions).

<P>The following coefficients must be defined for each dihedral type via the
<A HREF = "dihedral_coeff.html">dihedral_coeff</A> command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the <A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A>
or <A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A> commands:

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This dihedral style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
"molecular" package (which it is by default).  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#2_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info on packages.
