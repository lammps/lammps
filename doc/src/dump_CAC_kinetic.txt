dump cac/kinetic/energy command :h3

[Syntax:]

dump ID group-ID cac/kinetic/energy N file args :pre

ID = user-assigned name for the dump
group-ID = ID of the group of atoms/elements to be dumped
cac/kinetic/energy = style of dump command (other styles {atom} or {cfg} or {dcd} or {xtc} or {xyz} or {local} or {custom} are discussed on the "dump"_dump.html doc page)
N = dump every this many timesteps
file = name of file to write dump info to
args = same as arguments for "dump_style custom"_dump.html :ul

[Examples:]

dump meshvel all cac/kinetic/energy 1000 CACmeshvel.txt

[Description:]

Periodically outputs the per node kinetic energy due to each dimension of velocity
at the specified interval. This is printed for all finite elements for each of their respective
internal degrees of freedom; for atoms, denoted by the 0 element type, there will be one line
of data after the one line declaring the atom's type information.

NOTE: Unless the "dump_modify sort"_dump_modify.html option
is invoked, the atoms and finite elements will be written in an indeterminate 
order for each snapshot; nodes and internal degrees of freedom will belong to 
their respective finite element however.
