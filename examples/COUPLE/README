This directory has examples of how to use LAMMPS as a library, either
by itself or in tandem with another code or library.

These examples is meant to illustrate what is possible when coupling
codes or calling LAMMPS as a library.  The examples are provided for
demonstration purposes.  The physics they calculate is too simple to
model a realistic problem.

In many of the examples included here, LAMMPS must first be built as a
library.

See these sections of the LAMMPS manaul for details:

Build LAMMPS as a library (doc/Build_basics.html)
Link LAMMPS as a library to another code (doc/Build_link.html)
Coupling LAMMPS to other codes (doc/Howto_couple.html)
Using LAMMPS in client/server mode (doc/Howto_client_server.html)
Library interface to LAMMPS (doc/Howto_library.html)

The library interface to LAMMPS is in src/library.cpp.  Routines can
be easily added to this file so an external program can perform the
LAMMPS tasks desired.
