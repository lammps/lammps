Steps to set up a virtual machine for building RPMs

Configure a new virtual machine instance for each platform and distribution
Tested KVM/QEMU settings:
 1 CPU, 2048 MB RAM, 20 GB qcow2 disk image, VMVGA graphics, Core2duo CPU 32-bit/64-bit

Install distribution via CD/DVD ISO image (netinstall version)
- standard (non-LVM) partition layout, 2GB Swap only, 500MB /boot, rest /
- choose "Minimal" installation

Make sure the following additional packages (and dependencies) are installed

  + on RedHat/Fedora/CentOS:
    vim-enhanced openssh-clients python-devel tar screen
    yum-utils rpmdevtools rpm-build redhat-rpm-config createrepo
    git make gcc-c++ gcc-gfortran
    mpich-devel openmpi-devel fftw-devel libjpeg-turbo-devel libpng-devel

  + on OpenSuSE
    yast2-online-update-frontend
    vim-enhanced screen
    build rpm-build git-core python-devel createrepo
    openmpi-devel libjpeg8-devel fftw3-devel gcc-fortran gcc-c++ libpng-devel

Create user 'rpmbuild' and set password.
Use 'visudo' to allow 'rpmbuild' to shutdown the virtual machine
without a password by adding the line:

rpmbuild  ALL = NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown

Log in and create ssh key pair and append the public key the .ssh/authorized_keys
file of the repository account for automatic file transfer
Setup a suitable $HOME/.rpmmacros file
Run rpmdev-setuptree

Edit $HOME/.bash_profile to set environment variables for depositing files
MYRPM_REPO_HOST MYRPM_REPO_USER MYRPM_REPO_DIR

Clone LAMMPS-ICMS tree via:
 git clone git://git.lammps.org/lammps-icms.git lammps-icms

Build and sync the RPMs to the repository with:
cd lammps-icms;
git pull
./tools/rpm/build-rpm-from-git.sh
./tools/rpm/sync-to-repo.sh
