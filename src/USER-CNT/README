USER-CNT is a LAMMPS package for simulation of nanomechanics of carbon 
nanotubes (CNTs). The model is based on a coarse-grained representation 
of CNTs as "flexible cylinders" consisting of a variable number of 
segments. Internal interactions within a CNT and the van der Waals 
interaction between the tubes are described by a mesoscopic force 
field designed and parameterized based on the results of atomic-level 
molecular dynamics simulations. The description of the force field 
is provided in the papers listed below.

This package was created by Maxim Shugaev (mvs9t@virginia.edu) 
at the University of Virginia.
The Fortran library implementing basic level functions describing stretching, 
bending, and intertube components of the mesoscopic CNT force field, used
by this package is developed by Alexey N. Volkov (avolkov1@ua.edu) 
at the University of Alabama.

The following commands are contained in this package:

atom_style cnt
  This command enables cnt atom_style containing variables used for 
  further commands in USER-CNT.

pair_style cnt/tpm cut table_path BendingMode TPMType 
  This command activates a pair_style describing CNT mesoscopic tubular 
  potential model (TPM) force field. "cut" is cutoff distance that should 
  be set to be at least max(2.0*L, sqrt(L^2/2 + (2.0*R + Tcut)^2)), 
  where L is the maximum segment length, R is the maximum tube radius, 
  and Tcut = 10.2 A is the maximum distance between surfaces of interacting 
  segments.

compute cnt/Es, cnt/Eb, cnt/Et, cnt/B
  These commands allow for the evaluation of per atom values of stretching, 
  bending, and intertube interaction components of energies, and buckling
  flags.

compute cnt/Es_tot, cnt/Eb_tot, cnt/Et_tot
  These commands allow for the evaluation of total values of stretching, 
  bending, and intertube interaction energies.
