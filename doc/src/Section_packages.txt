4. Packages :h3

This section gives an overview of the optional packages that extend
LAMMPS functionality with instructions on how to build LAMMPS with
each of them.  Packages are groups of files that enable a specific set
of features.  For example, force fields for molecular systems or
granular systems are in packages.  You can see the list of all
packages and "make" commands to manage them by typing "make package"
from within the src directory of the LAMMPS distribution.  "Section
2.3"_Section_start.html#start_3 gives general info on how to install
and un-install packages as part of the LAMMPS build process.

There are two kinds of packages in LAMMPS, standard and user packages:

"Table of standard packages"_#table_standard
"Table of user packages"_#table_user :ul

Either of these kinds of packages may work as is, may require some
additional code compiled located in the lib folder, or may require
an external library to be downloaded, compiled, installed, and LAMMPS
configured to know about its location and additional compiler flags.
You can often do the build of the internal or external libraries
in one step by typing "make lib-name args='...'" from the src dir,
with appropriate arguments included in args='...'. If you just type
"make lib-name" you should see a help message about supported flags
and some examples. For more details about this, please study the
tables below and the sections about the individual packages.

Standard packages are supported by the LAMMPS developers and are
written in a syntax and style consistent with the rest of LAMMPS.
This means the developers will answer questions about them, debug and
fix them if necessary, and keep them compatible with future changes to
LAMMPS.

User packages have been contributed by users, and begin with the
"user" prefix.  If they are a single command (single file), they are
typically in the user-misc package.  User packages don't necessarily
meet the requirements of the standard packages. This means the
developers will try to keep things working and usually can answer
technical questions about compiling the package. If you have problems
using a feature provided in a user package, you may need to contact
the contributor directly to get help.  Information on how to submit
additions you make to LAMMPS as single files or as a standard or user
package are given in "this section"_Section_modify.html#mod_15 of the
manual.

Following the next two tables is a sub-section for each package.  It
lists authors (if applicable) and summarizes the package contents.  It
has specific instructions on how to install the package, including (if
necessary) downloading or building any extra library it requires. It
also gives links to documentation, example scripts, and
pictures/movies (if available) that illustrate use of the package.

NOTE: To see the complete list of commands a package adds to LAMMPS,
just look at the files in its src directory, e.g. "ls src/GRANULAR".
Files with names that start with fix, compute, atom, pair, bond,
angle, etc correspond to commands with the same style names.

In these two tables, the "Example" column is a sub-directory in the
examples directory of the distribution which has an input script that
uses the package.  E.g. "peptide" refers to the examples/peptide
directory; USER/atc refers to the examples/USER/atc directory.  The
"Library" column indicates whether an extra library is needed to build
and use the package:

dash = no library
sys = system library: you likely have it on your machine
int = internal library: provided with LAMMPS, but you may need to build it
ext = external library: you will need to download and install it on your machine :ul

GPU package :link(GPU),h4

[Contents:]

Dozens of pair styles and a version of the PPPM long-range Coulombic
solver optimized for GPUs.  All such styles have a "gpu" as a
suffix in their style name. The GPU code can be compiled with either
CUDA or OpenCL, however the OpenCL variants are no longer actively
maintained and only the CUDA versions are regularly tested.
"Section 5.3.1"_accelerate_gpu.html gives details of what
hardware and GPU software is required on your system,
and details on how to build and use this package.  Its styles can be
invoked at run time via the "-sf gpu" or "-suffix gpu" "command-line
switches"_Section_start.html#start_6.  See also the "KOKKOS"_#KOKKOS
package, which has GPU-enabled styles.

[Authors:] Mike Brown (Intel) while at Sandia and ORNL and Trung Nguyen
(Northwestern U) while at ORNL.

[Install or un-install:]

Before building LAMMPS with this package, you must first build the GPU
library in lib/gpu from a set of provided C and CUDA files.  You can
do this manually if you prefer; follow the instructions in
lib/gpu/README. Please note, that the GPU library uses MPI calls, so
you have to make certain to use the same MPI library (or the STUBS
library) settings as the main LAMMPS code. That same applies to the
-DLAMMPS_BIGBIG, -DLAMMPS_SMALLBIG, or -DLAMMPS_SMALLSMALL define.

You can also do it in one step from the lammps/src
dir, using a command like these, which simply invoke the
lib/gpu/Install.py script with the specified args:

make lib-gpu               # print help message
make lib-gpu args="-b"     # build GPU library with default Makefile.linux
make lib-gpu args="-m xk7 -p single -o xk7.single"  # create new Makefile.xk7.single, altered for single-precision
make lib-gpu args="-m mpi -p mixed -b" # build GPU library with mixed precision using settings in Makefile.mpi :pre

Note that this procedure through the '-m machine' flag starts with one of
the existing Makefile.machine files in lib/gpu. For your convenience,
machine makefiles for "mpi" and "serial" are provided, which have the
same settings as the corresponding machine makefiles in the main LAMMPS
source folder. In addition you can alter 4 important settings in that
Makefile, via the -h, -a, -p, -e switches, and also save a copy of the
new Makefile, if desired:

CUDA_HOME = where NVIDIA CUDA software is installed on your system
CUDA_ARCH = what GPU hardware you have (see help message for details)
CUDA_PRECISION = precision (double, mixed, single)
EXTRAMAKE = which Makefile.lammps.* file to copy to Makefile.lammps :ul

If the library build is successful, at least 3 files should be created:
lib/gpu/libgpu.a, lib/gpu/nvc_get_devices, and lib/gpu/Makefile.lammps.
The latter has settings that enable LAMMPS to link with CUDA libraries.
If the settings in Makefile.lammps for your machine are not correct,
the LAMMPS build will fail, and lib/gpu/Makefile.lammps may need to
be edited.

You can then install/un-install the package and build LAMMPS in the
usual manner:

make yes-gpu
make machine :pre

make no-gpu
make machine :pre

NOTE: If you re-build the GPU library in lib/gpu, you should always
un-install the GPU package, then re-install it and re-build LAMMPS.
This is because the compilation of files in the GPU package use the
library settings from the lib/gpu/Makefile.machine used to build the
GPU library.

KIM package :link(KIM),h4

[Contents:]

A "pair_style kim"_pair_kim.html command which is a wrapper on the
Knowledge Base for Interatomic Models (KIM) repository of interatomic
potentials, enabling any of them to be used in LAMMPS simulations.

To use this package you must have the KIM library available on your
system.

Information about the KIM project can be found at its website:
https://openkim.org.  The KIM project is led by Ellad Tadmor and Ryan
Elliott (U Minnesota) and James Sethna (Cornell U).

[Authors:] Ryan Elliott (U Minnesota) is the main developer for the KIM
API which the "pair_style kim"_pair_kim.html command uses.  He
developed the pair style in collaboration with Valeriu Smirichinski (U
Minnesota).

[Install or un-install:]

Before building LAMMPS with this package, you must first download and
build the KIM library and include the KIM models that you want to
use. You can do this manually if you prefer; follow the instructions
in lib/kim/README.  You can also do it in one step from the lammps/src
dir, using a command like these, which simply invoke the
lib/kim/Install.py script with the specified args.

make lib-kim              # print help message
make lib-kim args="-b "   # (re-)install KIM API lib with only example models
make lib-kim args="-b -a Glue_Ercolessi_Adams_Al__MO_324507536345_001"  # ditto plus one model
make lib-kim args="-b -a everything"     # install KIM API lib with all models
make lib-kim args="-n -a EAM_Dynamo_Ackland_W__MO_141627196590_002"       # add one model or model driver
make lib-kim args="-p /usr/local/kim-api" # use an existing KIM API installation at the provided location
make lib-kim args="-p /usr/local/kim-api -a EAM_Dynamo_Ackland_W__MO_141627196590_002" # ditto but add one model or driver :pre

Note that in LAMMPS lingo, a KIM model driver is a pair style
(e.g. EAM or Tersoff).  A KIM model is a pair style for a particular
element or alloy and set of parameters, e.g. EAM for Cu with a
specific EAM potential file.  Also note that installing the KIM API
library with all its models, may take around 30 min to build.  Of
course you only need to do that once.

See the list of KIM model drivers here:
https://openkim.org/kim-items/model-drivers/alphabetical

See the list of all KIM models here:
https://openkim.org/kim-items/models/by-model-drivers

See the list of example KIM models included by default here:
https://openkim.org/kim-api in the "What is in the KIM API source
package?" section

You can then install/un-install the package and build LAMMPS in the
usual manner:

make yes-kim
make machine :pre

make no-kim
make machine :pre

KOKKOS package :link(KOKKOS),h4

[Contents:]

Dozens of atom, pair, bond, angle, dihedral, improper, fix, compute
styles adapted to compile using the Kokkos library which can convert
them to OpenMP or CUDA code so that they run efficiently on multicore
CPUs, KNLs, or GPUs.  All the styles have a "kk" as a suffix in their
style name.  "Section 5.3.3"_accelerate_kokkos.html gives details of
what hardware and software is required on your system, and how to
build and use this package.  Its styles can be invoked at run time via
the "-sf kk" or "-suffix kk" "command-line
switches"_Section_start.html#start_6.  Also see the "GPU"_#GPU,
"OPT"_#OPT, "USER-INTEL"_#USER-INTEL, and "USER-OMP"_#USER-OMP
packages, which have styles optimized for CPUs, KNLs, and GPUs.

You must have a C++11 compatible compiler to use this package.

[Authors:] The KOKKOS package was created primarily by Christian Trott
and Stan Moore (Sandia), with contributions from other folks as well.
It uses the open-source "Kokkos library"_https://github.com/kokkos
which was developed by Carter Edwards, Christian Trott, and others at
Sandia, and which is included in the LAMMPS distribution in
lib/kokkos.

[Install or un-install:]

For the KOKKOS package, you have 3 choices when building.  You can
build with either CPU or KNL or GPU support.  Each choice requires
additional settings in your Makefile.machine for the KOKKOS_DEVICES
and KOKKOS_ARCH settings.  See the src/MAKE/OPTIONS/Makefile.kokkos*
files for examples.

For multicore CPUs using OpenMP:

KOKKOS_DEVICES = OpenMP
KOKKOS_ARCH = HSW           # HSW = Haswell, SNB = SandyBridge, BDW = Broadwell, etc :pre

For Intel KNLs using OpenMP:

KOKKOS_DEVICES = OpenMP
KOKKOS_ARCH = KNL :pre

For NVIDIA GPUs using CUDA:

KOKKOS_DEVICES = Cuda
KOKKOS_ARCH = Pascal60,Power8     # P100 hosted by an IBM Power8, etc
KOKKOS_ARCH = Kepler37,Power8     # K80 hosted by an IBM Power8, etc :pre

For GPUs, you also need these 2 lines in your Makefile.machine before
the CC line is defined, in this case for use with OpenMPI mpicxx.  The
2 lines define a nvcc wrapper compiler, which will use nvcc for
compiling CUDA files or use a C++ compiler for non-Kokkos, non-CUDA
files.

KOKKOS_ABSOLUTE_PATH = $(shell cd $(KOKKOS_PATH); pwd)
export OMPI_CXX = $(KOKKOS_ABSOLUTE_PATH)/config/nvcc_wrapper
CC =		mpicxx :pre

Once you have an appropriate Makefile.machine, you can
install/un-install the package and build LAMMPS in the usual manner.
Note that you cannot build one executable to run on multiple hardware
targets (CPU or KNL or GPU).  You need to build LAMMPS once for each
hardware target, to produce a separate executable.  Also note that we
do not recommend building with other acceleration packages installed
(GPU, OPT, USER-INTEL, USER-OMP) when also building with KOKKOS.

KSPACE package :link(KSPACE),h4

[Contents:]

A variety of long-range Coulombic solvers, as well as pair styles
which compute the corresponding short-range pairwise Coulombic
interactions.  These include Ewald, particle-particle particle-mesh
(PPPM), and multilevel summation method (MSM) solvers.

[Install or un-install:]

Building with this package requires a 1d FFT library be present on
your system for use by the PPPM solvers.  This can be the KISS FFT
library provided with LAMMPS, 3rd party libraries like FFTW, or a
vendor-supplied FFT library.  See step 6 of "Section
2.2.2"_Section_start.html#start_2_2 of the manual for details on how
to select different FFT options in your machine Makefile.

LATTE package :link(LATTE),h4

[Contents:]

A fix command which wraps the LATTE DFTB code, so that molecular
dynamics can be run with LAMMPS using density-functional tight-binding
quantum forces calculated by LATTE.

More information on LATTE can be found at this web site:
"https://github.com/lanl/LATTE"_latte_home.  A brief technical
description is given with the "fix latte"_fix_latte.html command.

:link(latte_home,https://github.com/lanl/LATTE)

[Authors:] Christian Negre (LANL) and Steve Plimpton (Sandia).  LATTE
itself is developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory by Marc
Cawkwell, Anders Niklasson, and Christian Negre.

[Install or un-install:]

Before building LAMMPS with this package, you must first download and
build the LATTE library.  You can do this manually if you prefer;
follow the instructions in lib/latte/README.  You can also do it in
one step from the lammps/src dir, using a command like these, which
simply invokes the lib/latte/Install.py script with the specified
args:

make lib-latte                          # print help message
make lib-latte args="-b"                # download and build in lib/latte/LATTE-master
make lib-latte args="-p $HOME/latte"    # use existing LATTE installation in $HOME/latte
make lib-latte args="-b -m gfortran"    # download and build in lib/latte and 
                                        #   copy Makefile.lammps.gfortran to Makefile.lammps
:pre

Note that 3 symbolic (soft) links, "includelink" and "liblink" and
"filelink", are created in lib/latte to point into the LATTE home dir.
When LAMMPS builds in src it will use these links.  You should 
also check that the Makefile.lammps file you create is apporpriate
for the compiler you use on your system to build LATTE.

You can then install/un-install the package and build LAMMPS in the
usual manner:

make yes-latte
make machine :pre

make no-latte

MEAM package :link(MEAM),h4

[Contents:]

A pair style for the modified embedded atom (MEAM) potential.

Please note that the MEAM package has been superseded by the
"USER-MEAMC"_#USER-MEAMC package, which is a direct translation
of the MEAM package to C++. USER-MEAMC contains additional
optimizations making it run faster than MEAM on most machines,
while providing the identical features and USER interface.

[Author:] Greg Wagner (Northwestern U) while at Sandia.

[Install or un-install:]

Before building LAMMPS with this package, you must first build the
MEAM library in lib/meam.  You can do this manually if you prefer;
follow the instructions in lib/meam/README.  You can also do it in one
step from the lammps/src dir, using a command like these, which simply
invoke the lib/meam/Install.py script with the specified args:

make lib-meam                  # print help message
make lib-meam args="-m mpi"    # build with default Fortran compiler compatible with your MPI library
make lib-meam args="-m serial" # build with compiler compatible with "make serial" (GNU Fortran)
make lib-meam args="-m ifort"  # build with Intel Fortran compiler using Makefile.ifort :pre

The build should produce two files: lib/meam/libmeam.a and
lib/meam/Makefile.lammps.  The latter is copied from an existing
Makefile.lammps.* and has settings needed to link C++ (LAMMPS) with
Fortran (MEAM library).  Typically the two compilers used for LAMMPS
and the MEAM library need to be consistent (e.g. both Intel or both
GNU compilers).  If necessary, you can edit/create a new
lib/meam/Makefile.machine file for your system, which should define an
EXTRAMAKE variable to specify a corresponding Makefile.lammps.machine
file.

You can then install/un-install the package and build LAMMPS in the
usual manner:

make yes-meam
make machine :pre

make no-meam
make machine :pre

NOTE: You should test building the MEAM library with both the Intel
and GNU compilers to see if a simulation runs faster with one versus
the other on your system.

written and read in parallel.

[Install or un-install:]

Note that MPIIO is part of the standard message-passing interface
(MPI) library, so you should not need any additional compiler or link
settings, beyond what LAMMPS normally uses for MPI on your system.

Mulit-Scale Coarse-Graining (MSCG) model using the open-source "MS-CG
library"_mscg_home.

:link(mscg_home,https://github.com/uchicago-voth/MSCG-release)

To use this package you must have the MS-CG library available on your
system.

[Authors:] The fix was written by Lauren Abbott (Sandia).  The MS-CG
library was developed by Jacob Wagner in Greg Voth's group at the
University of Chicago.

[Install or un-install:]

Before building LAMMPS with this package, you must first download and
build the MS-CG library.  Building the MS-CG library and using it from
LAMMPS requires a C++11 compatible compiler and that the GSL
(GNU Scientific Library) headers and libraries are installed on your
machine.  See the lib/mscg/README and MSCG/Install files for more details.

Assuming these libraries are in place, you can do the download and
build of MS-CG manually if you prefer; follow the instructions in
lib/mscg/README.  You can also do it in one step from the lammps/src
dir, using a command like these, which simply invoke the
lib/mscg/Install.py script with the specified args:

make lib-mscg             # print help message
make lib-mscg args="-b -m serial"   # download and build in lib/mscg/MSCG-release-master
                                    # with the settings compatible with "make serial"
make lib-mscg args="-b -m mpi"      # download and build in lib/mscg/MSCG-release-master
                                    # with the settings compatible with "make mpi"
make lib-mscg args="-p /usr/local/mscg-release" # use the existing MS-CG installation in /usr/local/mscg-release :pre

Note that 2 symbolic (soft) links, "includelink" and "liblink", will be created in lib/mscg
to point to the MS-CG src/installation dir.  When LAMMPS is built in src it will use these links.
You should not need to edit the lib/mscg/Makefile.lammps file.

POEMS package :link(POEMS),h4

[Contents:]

A fix that wraps the Parallelizable Open source Efficient Multibody

articulated body systems.  These are systems with multiple rigid
bodies (collections of particles) whose motion is coupled by
connections at hinge points.

[Author:] Rudra Mukherjee (JPL) while at RPI.

[Install or un-install:]

Before building LAMMPS with this package, you must first build the
POEMS library in lib/poems.  You can do this manually if you prefer;
follow the instructions in lib/poems/README.  You can also do it in
one step from the lammps/src dir, using a command like these, which
simply invoke the lib/poems/Install.py script with the specified args:

make lib-poems args="-m mpi"     # build with default MPI C++ compiler (settings as with "make mpi")
make lib-poems args="-m icc"     # build with Intel icc compiler :pre

The build should produce two files: lib/poems/libpoems.a and
lib/poems/Makefile.lammps.  The latter is copied from an existing
Makefile.lammps.* and has settings needed to build LAMMPS with the
POEMS library (though typically the settings are just blank).  If
necessary, you can edit/create a new lib/poems/Makefile.machine file

continuum finite element equations or perform on-the-fly conversion of
atomic information to continuum fields.

[Authors:] Reese Jones, Jeremy Templeton, Jon Zimmerman (Sandia).

[Install or un-install:]

Before building LAMMPS with this package, you must first build the ATC
library in lib/atc.  You can do this manually if you prefer; follow
the instructions in lib/atc/README.  You can also do it in one step
from the lammps/src dir, using a command like these, which simply
invoke the lib/atc/Install.py script with the specified args:

make lib-atc                      # print help message
make lib-atc args="-m serial"     # build with GNU g++ compiler and MPI STUBS (settings as with "make serial")
make lib-atc args="-m mpi"        # build with default MPI compiler (settings as with "make mpi")
make lib-atc args="-m icc"        # build with Intel icc compiler :pre

The build should produce two files: lib/atc/libatc.a and
lib/atc/Makefile.lammps.  The latter is copied from an existing
Makefile.lammps.* and has settings needed to build LAMMPS with the ATC
library.  If necessary, you can edit/create a new
lib/atc/Makefile.machine file for your system, which should define an
EXTRAMAKE variable to specify a corresponding Makefile.lammps.machine
file.

Note that the Makefile.lammps file has settings for the BLAS and
LAPACK linear algebra libraries.  As explained in lib/atc/README these
can either exist on your system, or you can use the files provided in
lib/linalg.  In the latter case you also need to build the library
in lib/linalg with a command like these:

make lib-linalg                     # print help message
make lib-linalg args="-m serial"    # build with GNU Fortran compiler (settings as with "make serial")
make lib-linalg args="-m mpi"       # build with default MPI Fortran compiler (settings as with "make mpi")
make lib-linalg args="-m gfortran"  # build with GNU Fortran compiler :pre

You can then install/un-install the package and build LAMMPS in the
usual manner:

make yes-user-atc

implement various enhanced sampling methods, including Adaptive
Biasing Force, Metadynamics, Steered MD, Umbrella Sampling and
Restraints.  A "fix colvars"_fix_colvars.html command is implemented
which wraps a COLVARS library, which implements these methods.
simulations.

[Authors:] The COLVARS library is written and maintained by
Giacomo Fiorin (ICMS, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA)
and Jerome Henin (LISM, CNRS, Marseille, France), originally for
the NAMD MD code, but with portability in mind.  Axel Kohlmeyer
(Temple U) provided the interface to LAMMPS.

USER-H5MD package :link(USER-H5MD),h4

[Contents:]

H5MD stands for HDF5 for MD.  "HDF5"_HDF5 is a portable, binary,
self-describing file format, used by many scientific simulations.
H5MD is a format for molecular simulations, built on top of HDF5.
This package implements a "dump h5md"_dump_h5md.html command to output
LAMMPS snapshots in this format.

:link(HDF5,http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5)

To use this package you must have the HDF5 library available on your
system.

[Author:] Pierre de Buyl (KU Leuven) created both the package and the
H5MD format.

[Install or un-install:]

Note that to follow these steps to compile and link to the CH5MD
library, you need the standard HDF5 software package installed on your
system, which should include the h5cc compiler and the HDF5 library.

Before building LAMMPS with this package, you must first build the
CH5MD library in lib/h5md.  You can do this manually if you prefer;
follow the instructions in lib/h5md/README.  You can also do it in one
step from the lammps/src dir, using a command like these, which simply
invoke the lib/h5md/Install.py script with the specified args:

make lib-h5md                     # print help message
make lib-hm5d args="-m h5cc"      # build with h5cc compiler :pre

The build should produce two files: lib/h5md/libch5md.a and
lib/h5md/Makefile.lammps.  The latter is copied from an existing
Makefile.lammps.* and has settings needed to build LAMMPS with the
system HDF5 library.  If necessary, you can edit/create a new
lib/h5md/Makefile.machine file for your system, which should define an
EXTRAMAKE variable to specify a corresponding Makefile.lammps.machine
file.

You can then install/un-install the package and build LAMMPS in the
usual manner:

make machine :pre

make no-user-h5md

USER-INTEL package :link(USER-INTEL),h4

[Contents:]

Dozens of pair, fix, bond, angle, dihedral, improper, and kspace
styles which are optimized for Intel CPUs and KNLs (Knights Landing).
All of them have an "intel" in their style name.  "Section
5.3.2"_accelerate_intel.html gives details of what hardware and
compilers are required on your system, and how to build and use this
package.  Its styles can be invoked at run time via the "-sf intel" or
"-suffix intel" "command-line switches"_Section_start.html#start_6.
Also see the "KOKKOS"_#KOKKOS, "OPT"_#OPT, and "USER-OMP"_#USER-OMP
packages, which have styles optimized for CPUs and KNLs.

You need to have an Intel compiler, version 14 or higher to take full
advantage of this package. While compilation with GNU compilers is
supported, performance will be suboptimal.

NOTE: the USER-INTEL package contains styles that require using the
-restrict flag, when compiling with Intel compilers.


[Author:] Mike Brown (Intel).

[Install or un-install:]

For the USER-INTEL package, you have 2 choices when building.  You can
build with either CPU or KNL support.  Each choice requires additional
settings in your Makefile.machine for CCFLAGS and LINKFLAGS and
optimized malloc libraries.  See the
src/MAKE/OPTIONS/Makefile.intel_cpu and src/MAKE/OPTIONS/Makefile.knl
files for examples.

For CPUs:

OPTFLAGS =      -xHost -O2 -fp-model fast=2 -no-prec-div -qoverride-limits
CCFLAGS =	-g -qopenmp -DLAMMPS_MEMALIGN=64 -no-offload \
-fno-alias -ansi-alias -restrict $(OPTFLAGS)
LINKFLAGS =	-g -qopenmp $(OPTFLAGS)
LIB =           -ltbbmalloc -ltbbmalloc_proxy :pre

For KNLs:

OPTFLAGS =      -xMIC-AVX512 -O2 -fp-model fast=2 -no-prec-div -qoverride-limits
CCFLAGS =	-g -qopenmp -DLAMMPS_MEMALIGN=64 -no-offload \
-fno-alias -ansi-alias -restrict $(OPTFLAGS)
LINKFLAGS =	-g -qopenmp $(OPTFLAGS)
LIB =           -ltbbmalloc :pre

Once you have an appropriate Makefile.machine, you can
install/un-install the package and build LAMMPS in the usual manner.
Note that you cannot build one executable to run on multiple hardware
targets (Intel CPUs or KNL).  You need to build LAMMPS once for each
hardware target, to produce a separate executable.

You should also typically install the USER-OMP package, as it can be
used in tandem with the USER-INTEL package to good effect, as
explained in "Section 5.3.2"_accelerate_intel.html.

USER-MOLFILE package :link(USER-MOLFILE),h4

[Contents:]

A "dump molfile"_dump_molfile.html command which uses molfile plugins
that are bundled with the "VMD"_vmd_home
molecular visualization and analysis program, to enable LAMMPS to dump
snapshots in formats compatible with various molecular simulation
tools.

:link(vmd_home,http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd)

To use this package you must have the desired VMD plugins available on
your system.

Note that this package only provides the interface code, not the
plugins themselves, which will be accessed when requesting a specific
plugin via the "dump molfile"_dump_molfile.html command.  Plugins can
be obtained from a VMD installation which has to match the platform
that you are using to compile LAMMPS for. By adding plugins to VMD,
support for new file formats can be added to LAMMPS (or VMD or other
programs that use them) without having to recompile the application
itself.  More information about the VMD molfile plugins can be found
at
"http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins/molfile"_http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins/molfile.

Note that to follow these steps, you need the standard NetCDF software
package installed on your system.  The lib/netcdf/Makefile.lammps file
has settings for NetCDF include and library files that LAMMPS needs to
compile and linkk with this package.  If the settings are not valid
for your system, you will need to edit the Makefile.lammps file.  See
lib/netcdf/README for details.

USER-OMP package :link(USER-OMP),h4

[Contents:]

Hundreds of pair, fix, compute, bond, angle, dihedral, improper, and
kspace styles which are altered to enable threading on many-core CPUs
via OpenMP directives.  All of them have an "omp" in their style name.
"Section 5.3.4"_accelerate_omp.html gives details of what hardware and
compilers are required on your system, and how to build and use this
package.  Its styles can be invoked at run time via the "-sf omp" or
"-suffix omp" "command-line switches"_Section_start.html#start_6.
Also see the "KOKKOS"_#KOKKOS, "OPT"_#OPT, and
"USER-INTEL"_#USER-INTEL packages, which have styles optimized for
CPUs.

[Author:] Axel Kohlmeyer (Temple U).

NOTE: To enable multi-threading support the compile flag "-fopenmp"
and the link flag "-fopenmp" (for GNU compilers, you have to look up
the equivalent flags for other compilers) must be used to build LAMMPS.
When using Intel compilers, also the "-restrict" flag is required.
The USER-OMP package can be compiled without enabling OpenMP; then
all code will be compiled as serial and the only improvement over the
regular styles are some data access optimization. These flags should
be added to the CCFLAGS and LINKFLAGS lines of your Makefile.machine.
See src/MAKE/OPTIONS/Makefile.omp for an example.

Once you have an appropriate Makefile.machine, you can
install/un-install the package and build LAMMPS in the usual manner:

[Install or un-install:]

make yes-user-omp
make machine :pre

make no-user-omp
make machine :pre

CCFLAGS: add -fopenmp (and -restrict when using Intel compilers)
LINKFLAGS: add -fopenmp :ul

matrices, which can then be used to compute phonon dispersion
relations, directly from molecular dynamics simulations.

USER-QMMM package :link(USER-QMMM),h4

[Contents:]

A "fix qmmm"_fix_qmmm.html command which allows LAMMPS to be used in a
QM/MM simulation, currently only in combination with the "Quantum
ESPRESSO"_espresso package.

:link(espresso,http://www.quantum-espresso.org)

To use this package you must have Quantum ESPRESSO available on your
system.

The current implementation only supports an ONIOM style mechanical
coupling to the Quantum ESPRESSO plane wave DFT package.
Electrostatic coupling is in preparation and the interface has been
written in a manner that coupling to other QM codes should be possible
without changes to LAMMPS itself.

[Author:] Axel Kohlmeyer (Temple U).

[Install or un-install:]

Before building LAMMPS with this package, you must first build the
QMMM library in lib/qmmm.  You can do this manually if you prefer;
follow the first two steps explained in lib/qmmm/README.  You can
also do it in one step from the lammps/src dir, using a command like
these, which simply invoke the lib/qmmm/Install.py script with the
specified args:

make lib-qmmm                      # print help message
make lib-qmmm args="-m serial"     # build with GNU Fortran compiler (settings as in "make serial")
make lib-qmmm args="-m mpi"        # build with default MPI compiler (settings as in "make mpi")
make lib-qmmm args="-m gfortran"   # build with GNU Fortran compiler :pre

The build should produce two files: lib/qmmm/libqmmm.a and
lib/qmmm/Makefile.lammps.  The latter is copied from an existing
Makefile.lammps.* and has settings needed to build LAMMPS with the
QMMM library (though typically the settings are just blank).  If
necessary, you can edit/create a new lib/qmmm/Makefile.machine file
for your system, which should define an EXTRAMAKE variable to specify
a corresponding Makefile.lammps.machine file.

You can then install/un-install the package and build LAMMPS in the
usual manner:

make yes-user-qmmm
make machine :pre

make no-user-qmmm
make machine :pre

NOTE: The LAMMPS executable these steps produce is not yet functional
for a QM/MM simulation.  You must also build Quantum ESPRESSO and
create a new executable which links LAMMPS and Quanutm ESPRESSO
together.  These are steps 3 and 4 described in the lib/qmmm/README
file.

USER-QTB package :link(USER-QTB),h4

[Contents:]

Two fixes which provide a self-consistent quantum treatment of
vibrational modes in a classical molecular dynamics simulation.  By
coupling the MD simulation to a colored thermostat, it introduces zero
point energy into the system, altering the energy power spectrum and
the heat capacity to account for their quantum nature. This is useful
when modeling systems at temperatures lower than their classical
limits or when temperatures ramp across the classical limits in a
simulation.

USER-QUIP package :link(USER-QUIP),h4

[Contents:]

A "pair_style quip"_pair_quip.html command which wraps the "QUIP
libAtoms library"_quip, which includes a variety of interatomic
potentials, including Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP) models
developed by the Cambridge University group.

:link(quip,https://github.com/libAtoms/QUIP)

To use this package you must have the QUIP libAatoms library available
on your system.

[Author:] Albert Bartok (Cambridge University)

[Install or un-install:]

Note that to follow these steps to compile and link to the QUIP
library, you must first download and build QUIP on your systems.  It
can be obtained from GitHub.  See step 1 and step 1.1 in the
lib/quip/README file for details on how to do this.  Note that it
requires setting two environment variables, QUIP_ROOT and QUIP_ARCH,
which will be accessed by the lib/quip/Makefile.lammps file which is
used when you compile and link LAMMPS with this package.  You should
only need to edit this file if the LAMMPS build can not use its
settings to successfully build on your system.

You can then install/un-install the package and build LAMMPS in the
usual manner:

make yes-user-quip
make machine :pre

make no-user-quip

USER-REAXC package :link(USER-REAXC),h4

[Contents:]

A pair style which implements the ReaxFF potential in C/C++ (in
contrast to the "REAX package"_#REAX and its Fortran library).  ReaxFF
is universal reactive force field.  See the src/USER-REAXC/README file
for more info on differences between the two packages.  Also two fixes
for monitoring molecules as bonds are created and destroyed.

USER-SMD package :link(USER-SMD),h4

[Contents:]

An atom style, fixes, computes, and several pair styles which
implements smoothed Mach dynamics (SMD) for solids, which is a model
related to smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) for liquids (see the
"USER-SPH package"_#USER-SPH).

This package solves solids mechanics problems via a state of the art
stabilized meshless method with hourglass control.  It can specify
hydrostatic interactions independently from material strength models,
i.e. pressure and deviatoric stresses are separated.  It provides many
material models (Johnson-Cook, plasticity with hardening,
Mie-Grueneisen, Polynomial EOS) and allows new material models to be
added.  It implements rigid boundary conditions (walls) which can be
specified as surface geometries from *.STL files.

[Author:] Georg Ganzenmuller (Fraunhofer-Institute for High-Speed
Dynamics, Ernst Mach Institute, Germany).

[Install or un-install:]

Before building LAMMPS with this package, you must first download the
Eigen library.  Eigen is a template library, so you do not need to
build it, just download it.  You can do this manually if you prefer;
follow the instructions in lib/smd/README.  You can also do it in one
step from the lammps/src dir, using a command like these, which simply
invoke the lib/smd/Install.py script with the specified args:

make lib-smd                         # print help message
make lib-smd args="-b"               # download and build in default lib/smd/eigen-eigen-...
make lib-smd args="-p /usr/include/eigen3"    # use existing Eigen installation in /usr/include/eigen3 :pre

Note that a symbolic (soft) link named "includelink" is created in
lib/smd to point to the Eigen dir.  When LAMMPS builds it will use
this link.  You should not need to edit the lib/smd/Makefile.lammps file.

You can then install/un-install the package and build LAMMPS in the
usual manner:

An atom style, fixes, computes, and several pair styles which
implements smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) for liquids.  See the
related "USER-SMD package"_#USER-SMD package for smooth Mach dynamics
(SMD) for solids.

This package contains ideal gas, Lennard-Jones equation of states,
Tait, and full support for complete (i.e. internal-energy dependent)
equations of state.  It allows for plain or Monaghans XSPH integration
of the equations of motion.  It has options for density continuity or
density summation to propagate the density field.  It has
"set"_set.html command options to set the internal energy and density
of particles from the input script and allows the same quantities to
be output with thermodynamic output or to dump files via the "compute
property/atom"_compute_property_atom.html command.
