------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory has source files to build a library that LAMMPS links against
when using the GPU package.

This library must be built with a C++ compiler along with CUDA, HIP, or OpenCL
before LAMMPS is built, so LAMMPS can link against it.

This library, libgpu.a, provides routines for acceleration of certain
LAMMPS styles and neighbor list builds using CUDA, OpenCL, or ROCm HIP.

Pair styles supported by this library are marked in the list of Pair style
potentials with a "g". See the online version at:

https://docs.lammps.org/Commands_pair.html

In addition the (plain) pppm kspace style is supported as well.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              DEVICE QUERY
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The gpu library includes binaries to check for available GPUs and their
properties. It is a good idea to run this on first use to make sure the
system and build is setup properly. Additionally, the GPU numbering for
specific selection of devices should be taking from this output. The GPU
library may split some accelerators into separate virtual accelerators for
efficient use with MPI.

After building the GPU library, for OpenCL:
  ./ocl_get_devices
for CUDA:
  ./nvc_get_devices
and for ROCm HIP:
  ./hip_get_devices

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              QUICK START

OpenCL: Mac with MPI:
  make -f Makefile.mac_opencl_mpi -j; cd ../../src/; make g++_openmpi -j
  mpirun -np $NUM_MPI ./lmp_g++_openmpi -in ../bench/in.lj -log none -sf gpu

OpenCL: Linux with Intel oneAPI:
  make -f Makefile.oneapi -j; cd ../../src; make oneapi -j
  export OMP_NUM_THREADS=$NUM_THREADS
  mpirun -np $NUM_MPI ./lmp_oneapi -in ../bench/in.lj -log none -sf gpu

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 Installing oneAPI, OpenCl, CUDA, or ROCm
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The easiest approach is to use the linux package manger to perform the
installation from Intel, NVIDIA, etc. repositories. All are available for
free. The oneAPI installation includes Intel optimized MPI and C++ compilers,
along with many libraries. Alternatively, Intel OpenCL can also be installed
separately from the Intel repository.

NOTE: Installation of the CUDA SDK is not required, only the CUDA toolkit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              Build Intro
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can type "make lib-gpu" from the src directory to see help on how
to build this library via make commands, or you can do the same thing
by typing "python Install.py" from within this directory, or you can
do it manually by following the instructions below.

Build the library using one of the provided Makefile.* files or create
your own, specific to your compiler and system.  For example:

make -f Makefile.linux_opencl

When you are done building this library, two files should
exist in this directory:

libgpu.a                the library LAMMPS will link against
Makefile.lammps         settings the LAMMPS Makefile will import

Makefile.lammps is created by the make command, by copying one of the
Makefile.lammps.* files.  See the EXTRAMAKE setting at the top of the
Makefile.* files.

IMPORTANT: You should examine the final Makefile.lammps to insure it is
correct for your system, else the LAMMPS build can fail.

IMPORTANT: If you re-build the library, e.g. for a different precision
(see below), you should do a "make clean" first, e.g. make -f
Makefile.linux clean, to insure all previous derived files are removed
before the new build is done.

NOTE: The system-specific setting LAMMPS_SMALLBIG (default), LAMMPS_BIGBIG,
      or LAMMPS_SMALLSMALL if specified when building LAMMPS (i.e. in
      src/MAKE/Makefile.foo) should be consistent with that specified
      when building libgpu.a (i.e. by LMP_INC in the lib/gpu/Makefile.bar).


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             PRECISION MODES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The GPU library supports 3 precision modes: single, double, and mixed, with
the latter being the default for most Makefiles aside from Mac specific
Makefiles due to the more restrictive nature of the Apple OpenCL for some
devices.

To specify the precision mode (output to the screen before LAMMPS runs for
verification), set either CUDA_PRECISION, OCL_PREC, or HIP_PRECISION to one
of -D_SINGLE_SINGLE, -D_DOUBLE_DOUBLE, or -D_SINGLE_DOUBLE.

Some accelerators or OpenCL implementations only support single precision.
This mode should be used with care and appropriate validation as the errors
can scale with system size in this implementation. This can be useful for
accelerating test runs when setting up a simulation for production runs on
another machine. In the case where only single precision is supported, either
LAMMPS must be compiled with -DFFT_SINGLE to use PPPM with GPU acceleration
or GPU acceleration should be disabled for PPPM (e.g. suffix off or pair/only
as described in the LAMMPS documentation).


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             CUDA BUILD NOTES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: when compiling with CMake, all of the considerations listed below
are considered within the CMake configuration process, so no separate
compilation of the gpu library is required. Also this will build in support
for all compute architecture that are supported by the CUDA toolkit version
used to build the gpu library.  A similar setup is possible using
Makefile.linux_multi after adjusting the settings for the CUDA toolkit in use.

Only CUDA toolkit version 8.0 and later and only GPU architecture 3.0
(aka Kepler) and later are supported by this version of LAMMPS. If you want
to use older hard- or software you have to compile for OpenCL or use an older
version of LAMMPS.

If you do not want to use a fat binary, that supports multiple CUDA
architectures, the CUDA_ARCH must be set to match the GPU architecture. This
is reported by nvc_get_devices executable created by the build process and
a detailed list of GPU architectures and CUDA compatible GPUs can be found
e.g. here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA#GPUs_supported

The CUDA_HOME variable should be set to the location of the CUDA toolkit.

To build, edit the CUDA_ARCH, CUDA_PRECISION, CUDA_HOME variables in one of
the Makefiles. CUDA_ARCH should be set based on the compute capability of
your GPU. This can be verified by running the nvc_get_devices executable after
the build is complete. Additionally, the GPU package must be installed and
compiled for LAMMPS. This may require editing the gpu_SYSPATH variable in the
LAMMPS makefile.

Please note that the GPU library accesses the CUDA driver library directly,
so it needs to be linked with the CUDA driver library (libcuda.so) that ships
with the Nvidia driver. If you are compiling LAMMPS on the head node of a GPU
cluster, this library may not be installed, so you may need to copy it over
from one of the compute nodes (best into this directory). Recent CUDA toolkits
starting from CUDA 9 provide a dummy libcuda.so library (typically under
$(CUDA_HOME)/lib64/stubs), that can be used for linking.

Best performance with the GPU library is typically with multiple MPI processes
sharing the same GPU cards. For NVIDIA, this is most efficient with CUDA
MPS enabled. To prevent runtime errors for GPUs configured in exclusive process
mode with MPS, the GPU library should be build with either of the equivalent
-DCUDA_MPS_SUPPORT or -DCUDA_PROXY flags.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             HIP BUILD NOTES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. GPU sorting requires installing hipcub
(https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/hipCUB). The HIP CUDA-backend
additionally requires cub (https://nvlabs.github.io/cub). Download and
extract the cub directory to lammps/lib/gpu/ or specify an appropriate
path in lammps/lib/gpu/Makefile.hip.
2. In Makefile.hip it is possible to specify the target platform via
export HIP_PLATFORM=amd (ROCm >= 4.1), HIP_PLATFORM=hcc (ROCm <= 4.0)
or HIP_PLATFORM=nvcc as well as the target architecture (gfx803, gfx900, gfx906 etc.)
3. If your MPI implementation does not support `mpicxx --showme` command,
it is required to specify the corresponding MPI compiler and linker flags
in lammps/lib/gpu/Makefile.hip and in lammps/src/MAKE/OPTIONS/Makefile.hip.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             OPENCL BUILD NOTES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If GERYON_NUMA_FISSION is defined at build time, LAMMPS will consider separate
NUMA nodes on GPUs or accelerators as separate devices. For example, a 2-socket
CPU would appear as two separate devices for OpenCL (and LAMMPS would require
two MPI processes to use both sockets with the GPU library - each with its
own device ID as output by ocl_get_devices). OpenCL version 1.2 or later is
required.

For a debug build, use "-DUCL_DEBUG -DGERYON_KERNEL_DUMP" and remove
"-DUCL_NO_EXIT" and "-DMPI_GERYON" from the build options.
