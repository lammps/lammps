fix wall/ees command :h3

fix wall/region/ees command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID wall/ees face args ... keyword value ... :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
one or more face/arg pairs may be appended :l
face = {xlo} or {xhi} or {ylo} or {yhi} or {zlo} or {zhi} :l
  args = coord epsilon sigma cutoff
    coord = position of wall = EDGE or constant or variable
      EDGE = current lo or hi edge of simulation box
      constant = number like 0.0 or -30.0 (distance units)
      variable = "equal-style variable"_variable.html like v_x or v_wiggle
    epsilon = strength factor for wall-particle interaction (energy or energy/distance^2 units)
      epsilon can be a variable (see below)
    sigma = size factor for wall-particle interaction (distance units)
      sigma can be a variable (see below)
    cutoff = distance from wall at which wall-particle interaction is cut off (distance units) :pre
:ule



fix ID group-ID wall/region/ees region-ID epsilon sigma cutoff :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command
wall/region = style name of this fix command
region-ID = region whose boundary will act as wall
epsilon = strength factor for wall-particle interaction (energy or energy/distance^2 units)
sigma = size factor for wall-particle interaction (distance units)
cutoff = distance from wall at which wall-particle interaction is cut off (distance units) :ul

[Examples:]

fix wallhi all wall/ees xhi EDGE 1.0 1.0 2.5
fix wallhi all wall/ees v_wiggle 23.2 1.0 1.0 2.5

fix ees_cube all wall/region/ees myCube 1.0 1.0 2.5 :pre


[Description:]
 
"Fix wall/ees" bounds the simulation domain on one or more of its faces with a flat
wall that interacts with the ellipsoidal atoms in the group by generating a force
on the atom in a direction perpendicular to the wall and a torque parallel with the wall.  The energy of
wall-particle interactions E is given by:




:c,image(Eqs/fix_wall_ees.jpg)
 
 
Introduced by Babadi and Ejtehadi in "(Babadi)"_#BabadiEjtehadi. Here, {r} is the distance from the particle to the wall at
position {coord}, and Rc is the {cutoff} distance at which the 
particle and wall no longer interact. Also,  sigma_n is the distance between center of ellipsoid and the nearest point of its surface to the wall  The energy of the wall (see the image below).

Details of using this command and specifications are the same as fix/wall command. You can also find an example in USER/ees/ under examples/ directory. 
 
The prefactor {epsilon} can be thought of as an
effective Hamaker constant with energy units for the strength of the
ellipsoid-wall interaction.  More specifically, the {epsilon} pre-factor
= 8 * pi^2 * rho_wall * rho_ellipsoid * epsilon * sigma_a * sigma_b * sigma_c, where epsilon
is the LJ parameters for the constituent LJ
particles and sigma_a, sigma_b, and sigma_c are radii of ellipsoidal particles. Rho_wall and rho_ellipsoid are the number density of the
constituent particles, in the wall and ellipsoid respectively, in units
of 1/volume.
 
NOTE: You must insure that r is always bigger than sigma_n for
all particles in the group, or LAMMPS will generate an error.  This
means you cannot start your simulation with particles touching the wall
position {coord} (r = sigma_n) or with particles penetrating the wall (0 =< r < sigma_n) or with particles on the wrong side of the
wall (r < 0). 



"fix wall/region/ees" treat the surface of the geometric region defined by the {region-ID}
as a bounding wall which interacts with nearby ellipsoidal particles according to
the EES potential introduced above.

Other details of this command is the same wiht "fix wall/region"_fix_wall_region.html command. 
One may also find and exapmle of using this code in USER/ees/ under examples/ directory. 

[Restrictions:] 

This fix is part of the USER-MISC package.  It is only enabled if LAMMPS
was built with that package.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info.

This fix requires that atoms be ellipsoids as defined by the
"atom_style ellipsoid"_atom_style.html command.

"pair resquared"_pair_resquared.html

[Default:]

The option defaults units = lattice, fld = no, and pbc = no.
