Syntax

Examples

Description
"""""""""""

The *cosine/delta* angle style uses the potential

   :align: center

where theta0 is the equilibrium value of the angle, and K is a
prefactor.  Note that the usual 1/2 factor is included in K.

The following coefficients must be defined for each angle type via the
:doc:`angle_coeff <angle_coeff>` command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the :doc:`read_data <read_data>`
or :doc:`read_restart <read_restart>` commands:

* K (energy)
* theta0 (degrees)

Theta0 is specified in degrees, but LAMMPS converts it to radians
internally.


----------


Styles with a *cuda*, *gpu*, *intel*, *kk*, *omp*, or *opt* suffix are
functionally the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.
They have been optimized to run faster, depending on your available
hardware, as discussed in :doc:`Section_accelerate <Section_accelerate>`
of the manual.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and
should produce the same results, except for round-off and precision
issues.

These accelerated styles are part of the USER-CUDA, GPU, USER-INTEL,
KOKKOS, USER-OMP and OPT packages, respectively.  They are only
enabled if LAMMPS was built with those packages.  See the :ref:`Making LAMMPS <start_3>` section for more info.

You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the :ref:`-suffix command-line switch <start_7>` when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can
use the :doc:`suffix <suffix>` command in your input script.

See :doc:`Section_accelerate <Section_accelerate>` of the manual for
more instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.

Restrictions
""""""""""""


This angle style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
MOLECULE package (which it is by default).  See the :ref:`Making LAMMPS <start_3>` section for more info on packages.
