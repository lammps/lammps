[Description:]

These pair styles have a soft repulsive core, tunable by a parameter lambda,
in order to avoid singularities during free energy calculations when sites are
created or annihilated "(Beutler)"_#Beutler.  When lambda tends to 0 the pair
interaction vanishes with a soft repulsive core.  When lambda tends to 1, the pair
interaction approaches the normal, non-soft potential. These pair styles
are suited for "alchemical" free energy calculations using the "fix
adapt/fep"_fix_adapt_fep.html and "compute fep"_compute_fep.html commands.

The {lj/cut/soft} style and related sub-styles compute the 12-6 Lennard-Jones
and Coulomb potentials modified by a soft core, with the functional form

:c,image(Eqs/pair_lj_soft.jpg)

The {lj/class2/soft} style is a 9-6 potential with the exponent of the
denominator of the first term in brackets taking the value 1.5 instead of 2
(other details differ, see the form of the potential in
"pair_class2"_pair_class2.html).

Coulomb interactions can also be damped with a soft core at short distance,

:c,image(Eqs/pair_coul_soft.jpg)

In the Coulomb part C is an energy-conversion constant, q_i and q_j
are the charges on the 2 atoms, and epsilon is the dielectric constant
which can be set by the "dielectric"_dielectric.html command.

The coefficient lambda is an activation parameter. When lambda = 1 the pair
potential is identical to a Lennard-Jones term or a Coulomb term or a
combination of both. When lambda = 0 the interactions are deactivated. The
transition between these two extrema is smoothed by a soft repulsive core in
order to avoid singularities in potential energy and forces when sites are
created or annihilated and can overlap "(Beutler)"_#Beutler.

The parameters n, alpha_LJ and alpha_C are set in the
"pair_style"_pair_style.html command, before the cutoffs.  Usual choices for the
exponent are n = 2 or n = 1. For the remaining coefficients alpha_LJ = 0.5 and
alpha_C = 10 Angstrom^2 are appropriate choices. Plots of the 12/6 LJ and
Coulomb terms are shown below, for lambda ranging from 1 to 0 every 0.1.

:c

For the {lj/cut/coul/cut/soft} or {lj/cut/coul/long/soft} pair styles, as well
as for the equivalent {class2} versions, the following coefficients must be
defined for each pair of atoms types via the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html
command as in the examples above, or in the data file or restart files read by
the "read_data"_read_data.html or "read_restart"_read_restart.html commands, or
by mixing as described below:

epsilon (energy units)
sigma (distance units)
lambda (activation parameter, between 0 and 1)
cutoff1 (distance units)
cutoff2 (distance units) :ul

The latter two coefficients are optional.  If not specified, the global
LJ and Coulombic cutoffs specified in the pair_style command are used.
If only one cutoff is specified, it is used as the cutoff for both LJ
and Coulombic interactions for this type pair.  If both coefficients
are specified, they are used as the LJ and Coulombic cutoffs for this
type pair.  You cannot specify 2 cutoffs for style {lj/cut/soft},
since it has no Coulombic terms. For the {coul/cut/soft} and
{coul/long/soft} only lambda and the optional cutoff2 are to be
specified.

Style {lj/cut/tip4p/long/soft} implements a soft-core version of the TIP4P water
model. The usage of the TIP4P pair style is documented in the
"pair_lj"_pair_lj.html styles. In the soft version the parameters n, alpha_LJ
and alpha_C are set in the "pair_style"_pair_style.html command, after the
specific parameters of the TIP4P water model and before the cutoffs. The
activation parameter lambda is supplied as an argument of the the
"pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command, after epsilon and sigma and before the
optional cutoffs.

Style {lj/charmm/coul/long/soft} implements a soft-core version of the modified
12-6 LJ potential used in CHARMM and documented in the
"pair_lj_charmm"_pair_charmm.html style. In the soft version the parameters n,
alpha_LJ and alpha_C are set in the "pair_style"_pair_style.html command, before
the global cutoffs. The activation parameter lambda is introduced as an argument
of the the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command, after epsilon and sigma and
before the optional eps14 and sigma14.

Style {lj/class2/soft} implements a soft-core version of the 9-6 potential in
"pair_class2"_pair_class2.html. In the soft version the parameters n, alpha_LJ
and alpha_C are set in the "pair_style"_pair_style.html command, before the
global cutoffs. The activation parameter lambda is introduced as an argument of
the the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command, after epsilon and sigma and before
the optional cutoffs.

The {coul/cut/soft}, {coul/long/soft} and {tip4p/long/soft} sub-styles
are designed to be combined with other pair potentials via the
"pair_style hybrid/overlay"_pair_hybrid.html command.  This is because
they have no repulsive core.  Hence, if used by themselves, there will
be no repulsion to keep two oppositely charged particles from
overlapping each other. In this case, if lambda = 1, a singularity may
occur.  These sub-styles are suitable to represent charges embedded in
the Lennard-Jones radius of another site (for example hydrogen atoms
in several water models).

NOTE: When using the soft-core Coulomb potentials with long-range
solvers ({coul/long/soft}, {lj/cut/coul/long/soft}, etc.)  in a free
energy calculation in which sites holding electrostatic charges are
being created or annihilated (using "fix adapt/fep"_fix_adapt_fep.html
and "compute fep"_compute_fep.html) it is important to adapt both the
lambda activation parameter (from 0 to 1, or the reverse) and the
value of the charge (from 0 to its final value, or the reverse). This
ensures that long-range electrostatic terms (kspace) are correct. It
is not necessary to use soft-core Coulomb potentials if the van der
Waals site is present during the free-energy route, thus avoiding
overlap of the charges. Examples are provided in the LAMMPS source
directory tree, under examples/USER/fep.

NOTE: To avoid division by zero do not set sigma = 0 in the {lj/cut/soft} and
related styles; use the lambda parameter instead to activate/deactivate
interactions, or use epsilon = 0 and sigma = 1. Alternatively, when sites do not
interact though the Lennard-Jones term the {coul/long/soft} or similar sub-style
can be used via the "pair_style hybrid/overlay"_pair_hybrid.html command.

The {morse/soft} variant modifies the "pair_morse"_pair_morse.html style at
short range to have a soft core. The functional form differs from that of the
{lj/soft} styles, and is instead given by:

:c,image(Eqs/pair_morse_soft.jpg)

The {morse/soft} style requires the following pair coefficients:

D0 (energy units)
alpha (1/distance units)
r0 (distance units)
lambda (unitless, between 0.0 and 1.0)
cutoff (distance units) :ul

The last coefficient is optional. If not specified, the global morse cutoff is
used.

Styles with a {gpu}, {intel}, {kk}, {omp}, or {opt} suffix are
functionally the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.
They have been optimized to run faster, depending on your available
hardware, as discussed on the "Speed packages"_Speed_packages.html doc
page.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and should
produce the same results, except for round-off and precision issues.

These accelerated styles are part of the GPU, USER-INTEL, KOKKOS,
USER-OMP and OPT packages, respectively.  They are only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with those packages.  See the "Build
package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.

You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the "-suffix command-line
switch"_Run_options.html when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can use the
"suffix"_suffix.html command in your input script.

See the "Speed packages"_Speed_packages.html doc page for more
instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.

[Mixing, shift, tail correction, restart info]:

The different versions of the {lj/cut/soft} pair styles support mixing.  For atom
type pairs I,J and I != J, the epsilon and sigma coefficients and cutoff
distance for these pair style can be mixed.  The default mix value is
{geometric} for 12-6 styles.

The mixing rule for epsilon and sigma for {lj/class2/soft} 9-6 potentials is to use the
{sixthpower} formulas. The "pair_modify mix"_pair_modify.html setting is thus
ignored for class2 potentials for epsilon and sigma. However it is still
followed for mixing the cutoff distance. See the "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html
command for details.

The {morse/soft} pair style does not support mixing. Thus, coefficients for all
LJ pairs must be specified explicitly.

All of the pair styles with soft core support the "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html
shift option for the energy of the Lennard-Jones portion of the pair
interaction.

The different versions of the {lj/cut/soft} pair styles support the
"pair_modify"_pair_modify.html tail option for adding a long-range tail
correction to the energy and pressure for the Lennard-Jones portion of the pair
interaction.

NOTE: The analytical form of the tail corrections for energy and pressure used
in the {lj/cut/soft} potentials are approximate, being identical to that of the
corresponding non-soft potentials scaled by a factor lambda^n. The errors due to
this approximation should be negligible. For example, for a cutoff of 2.5 sigma
this approximation leads to maximum relative errors in tail corrections of the
order of 1e-4 for energy and virial (alpha_LJ = 0.5, n = 2). The error vanishes
when lambda approaches 0 or 1. Note that these are the errors affecting the
long-range tail (itself a correction to the interaction energy) which includes
other approximations, namely that the system is homogeneous (local density equal
the average density) beyond the cutoff.

The {morse/soft} pair style does not support the "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html
tail option for adding long-range tail corrections to energy and pressure.

All of these pair styles write information to "binary restart
files"_restart.html, so pair_style and pair_coeff commands do not need to be
specified in an input script that reads a restart file.

[Restrictions:]

The pair styles with soft core are only enabled if LAMMPS was built with the
USER-FEP package. The {long} versions also require the KSPACE package to be
installed. The soft {tip4p} versions also require the MOLECULE package to be
installed. These styles are only enabled if LAMMPS was built with those
packages.  See the "Build package"_Build_package.html doc page for more
info.
