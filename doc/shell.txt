shell command :h3

[Syntax:]

shell style args :pre

style = {cd} or {mkdir} or {mv} or {rm} or {rmdir} :ulb,l
  {cd} arg = dir
    dir = directory to change to
  {mkdir} args = dir1 dir2 ...
    dir1,dir2 = one or more directories to create
  {mv} args = old new
    old = old filename
    new = new filename
  {rm} args = file1 file2 ...
    file1,file2 = one or more filenames to delete
  {rmdir} args = dir1 dir2 ...
    dir1,dir2 = one or more directories to delete :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

shell cd sub1
shell cd ..
shell mkdir tmp1 tmp2 tmp3
shell rmdir tmp1
shell mv log.lammps hold/log.1
shell rm TMP/file1 TMP/file2 :pre

[Description:]

Execute a shell command.  Only a few simple file-based shell commands
are supported, in Unix-style syntax.  With the exception of {cd}, all
commands are executed by only a single processor, so that
files/directories are not being manipulated by multiple processors.

The {cd} style executes the Unix "cd" command to change the working
directory.  All subsequent LAMMPS commands that read/write files will
use the new directory.  All processors execute this command.

The {mkdir} style executes the Unix "mkdir" command to create
one or more directories.

The {mv} style executes the Unix "mv" command to rename a file and/or
move it to a new directory.

The {rm} style executes the Unix "rm" command to remove one or more
files.

The {rmdir} style executes the Unix "rmdir" command to remove one or
more directories.  A directory must be empty to be successfully
removed.

[Restrictions:]

LAMMPS does not detect errors or print warnings when any of these Unix
commands execute.  E.g. if the specified directory does not exist,
executing the {cd} command will silently not do anything.
