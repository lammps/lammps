</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>The <I>harmonic/shift/cut</I> bond style is a shifted harmonic bond that
uses the potential
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/bond_harmonic_shift_cut.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>where r0 is the equilibrium bond distance, and rc the critical distance.
The bond potential is zero for distances r > rc. The potential is -Umin
at r0 and zero at rc. The spring constant is k = Umin / [ 2 (r0-rc)^2].
</P>
<P>The following coefficients must be defined for each bond type via the
<A HREF = "bond_coeff.html">bond_coeff</A> command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the <A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A>
or <A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A> commands:

<LI>r0 (distance)
<LI>rc (distance)

<P>Styles with a <I>cuda</I>, <I>gpu</I>, <I>omp</I>, or <I>opt</I> suffix are functionally
the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.  They have
been optimized to run faster, depending on your available hardware, as
discussed in <A HREF = "Section_accelerate.html">Section_accelerate</A> of the
manual.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and should
produce the same results, except for round-off and precision issues.
</P>
<P>These accelerated styles are part of the USER-CUDA, GPU, USER-OMP and OPT
packages, respectively.  They are only enabled if LAMMPS was built with
those packages.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making LAMMPS</A>
section for more info.
</P>
<P>You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_7">-suffix command-line
switch</A> when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can
use the <A HREF = "suffix.html">suffix</A> command in your input script.
</P>
<P>See <A HREF = "Section_accelerate.html">Section_accelerate</A> of the manual for
more instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.
</P>

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This bond style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
USER-MISC package.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making LAMMPS</A>
section for more info on packages.
